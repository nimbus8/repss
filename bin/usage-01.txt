- then it hit me, every story I'd ever /[(heard|read)] was exactly the same. You'd think I'd be outraged
But no, I wasn't bothered, how could I be? Besides the devil's in the details, 
and boy that /[(guy| m************r)]'s a drama queen. /[(I swear to god it|I swear it|It)]'s every little thing 
with /[(this guy|him)], you won't hear the end of it - nor should you if the pages fall 
anywhere short of inspiring /[(and|or)] insightful. Your internal workings are adaptive but simple, and while
/[(there may be great satisfaction in winning|it imay feel great to win)] big games against less trained
competition - in the end you aren't doing yourself any favors, only them.


Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|gawd awful)]
time trying to /[(figure out|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring 
/[(characters|people)] into a scene, kick them out, and have others /[(|just)] pass through 
/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader. /[(|Cuz n|N)]o bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their 
"hopped" up on caffeine, no. Silly bunnies,when caught with /[(the substance|caffeine)] they claimed dislexia 
/[(and were even more exited when they got off.|- and got off.)]


We were singing 'Taaaaaake ME out to the BAAAALL gaaaame, taake ME out to just seeeee'
all sloshy and drunk - even the coaches joined in with us this time.
/[(I'd|I've)] never seen the old man /[(wasted|so wasted)], I kept my distance thinking he might come over 
and disown us in front of all these people. /[(For that terrible game|What a terrible game)]. We were long out of the
playoffs and this final /[(match|game|loss) was /[(to end|the end to)] a miserable drugdery.
We were all stuck in this mechanical going about of things and /[(we didn't know why|no one /[(dared|thought)] to ask 'how come?')].
/[(With the season done, t|T)]he coaches could go back to thinking of how best to
replace every last one of us, the players could finally get back to their lives outside 
of the game, and I would never have to see harry Larry's silly mug again. He punched
me in the shoulder and thanked me for the seasons worth of mentorship while I resisted
the urge to clock him /[(in the face|straight to the floor)].
<<Hey sorry champ, I know that/[('s|was)] your good arm/[(| and all)]!>>, he joked
<<So where you heading?>> I asked jovially.
<<Going back to Indiana,>> he replied <<there's some people there that are
comin and you know I can't miss that.>>
<<Very nice, hey did you get a look at Johnny's picture?>>
<<HO HO HO! JOHNNAAAAAYY! What's this I hear about another dirty /[(photo|movie)]?>>
The man was a god - not Larry, Johnny - who had a photographic memory and 
some /[(damn|darn)] fine drawing skills/[(:|, he was by far the most liked on the team::)].
The first bus ride we had together /[(:as a team|:: )]
he practically drew out the entire 89 edition of Harlequim. The boys would
spoil it of course and he would tirelessly get to work on several others.
But he did grow tired of the routine. We knew it /[(:|when::)] at once /[(:when|:: )] he nearly
threw /[(one of us|the closest man to him)] out the window
/[(|, the poor guy was so distrought he nearly edged himself over)]
out onto incoming traffic. He was funny that way/[(, and we:|. We::)] were of 
course privledged if he ever made another one/[(:. S|::, s)]o we tried not to
ruin them too quickly when he did. I thinkfor that reason, we all, at least subconsciously, made sure /[(we|to|we'd)] let Larry know last.
And as he shimmied past a sea of our team members at the bar, over to an expectant Johnny who was ready with double fives and drunken cheers,
I reflected on the irony of it all -- the league champions wouldn't be so /[(jubilant|happy)]! 
It was life's turn to start throwing things at me, and me being sh*t at bat, the whole thing really gave me hope you know.
 
 
Brute force poetry: The idea that if you think and write about something long 
enough, and know how to /[(navigate and manouever:|navigate/manouever::)] through 
/[(:those thoughts|::that thinking and writing)] /[(:::|, ::::)]effectively/[(:::,|:::: )]
you'll bang out something better than you would otherwise, not necessarily
good, but certainly not crap. Writing crap (at least for me) is effortless.


....
As we made our way through what /[(|had just:|::just::)] minutes ago /[(:officially become my apartment|::had officially become my apartment)],
I was thouroughly briefed to /[(ensure|make /[(certain|sure)])] /[(that during my time there I'd keep within|my time there would not conflict with|my stay would stay within)]
the rules /[(outlined by the official 'body of governance', who took themselves very seriously | outlined in print by a /[('body of governance'|'governing body')], who took themselves quite seriously| by the governance of the building|of the building)]. 
/[(To be honest, if ever I cared to break the rules I figured|I figured if I /[(ever cared to break|would ever)] the rules|Not one for facist dictatorship I swore to myself)]
I'd consult the accompanying documentation /[(to lead my actions in accordance with the law that'd probably see me do years if not more for something like indescent exposure whilst painting over /[(these walls, the|the walls in the)] main corridor, the lobby, and /[(|and then the|the)]reception.)].
For this encyclopedia they /[(|had)] paid a local publishing house good money in hard cover, money they took great care to allot in the quarterly budget - the very same /[(budget|one)] that would /[(would be grossly exceeded then ripped /[(in two /[(|peices)]|to peices)] at year's end|inevitably be exceeded)]
because of market forces /[(noone could /[(have /[(|possibly)] seen coming|/[(|possibly)] foresee)]|beyond their control)>and were ultimately, <]: too many 
residents wanted in and /[(a number nearly the same left to live elsewhere without a letter or even a goodbye.|nearly the same number wanted out.)]:
But of course I didn't know this then, so I foolishly sought refuge in /[(a state of deep unstructured thinking|/[(deep unstructured thought of my own /[(making|division|devise)].|a standing state of::)] /[(::antipathy|::slumber)>and<])],
/[(|and)] /[(oh and how he walked|how he walked)> <] (/[(as well|as swell)>and<](*) as any other) /[(|could or has ever done)].
Half alert and barely awake, /[(wholly by accident I caught:|somewhere after)] her /[(|stern)] warning /[(|to)] me that 
I /[(<<NEEDN'T ASK FOR THE ANSWER>> WAS /[(ALWAYS|BOUND)] TO /[(|BE)] <<NEVER>> | <<MOST CERTAINLY>> WAS NOT TO <<PAINT THE WALLS>>,)]
/[(:. Then quickly after, | shortly after)] 
/[(I was struck with a sudden worry that the lengthy elevator up (and down) would prove too much. 2 minutes both ways, everyday, sometimes twice, lets say - /[(|Oi Vey -)] | I began to wonder whether I'd be able to stomach the long elevaor up.)].
Just then, a sharp whistle broke through my /[(thinking|thoughts)] /[(/[(of|to)] which I /[(|of course)] took notice -|requesting that I take notice:)] 
/[(|:take:)] /[(|:greater:)] /[(: ::|:notice:::)] of  /[(this|:: |:::this::::)] /[(|::::freckled)] lady (*). 
/[(|The landlady:)]/[(|,)] /[(|:who:)] /[(:looked impatient::|:was)] /[(|::with me)] tapping away /[(|incessantly)])] at the bottom 
of /[(this large|a large|a)] crystal mug /[(that sat alone in the middle of the sink|sitting in the middle of the sink)]. 
<<Did you hear what I just said?>>   
No.
<<Huh? ugh...there's a dishwasher, isn't there?>>
<<Like I said, only take this off when your washing up. There's some spray underneath in case you need.>>
I had no idea what she was talking about /[(.:|, of course, and::)] I had given myself away /[(:, of course.|::.)]
That I wasn't "from here" was /[(|now|evidently)> ><] clear.  Oh, and she laaaaaaaaaauuuuuugggghed! /[(|Oh dear,)]
/[(She laughed l|L)]ike she always does, at every new
immigrant and import to the city where the rodents outnumber the /[(population|populace)] tenfold in every alley 
/[(|,corner, creek, and crevice - that is, nearly ever locale, enclave, and bourough /[(in proximity|within appreciable distance)] /[(|to anything /[(|and everything)] of /[(relevance:|importance|worth::)> >or<] in this city)] was infested!  How they /[(ever managed |continue still)> >and<] to cover up the fact /[(it|, that the infestation)] had become the cities 
third leading cause /[(for|of)] /[(hospitalization|hospitalization and/or death|death)], I don't know.  I met a nurse who claimed they'd often couple /[(it|the statistic)]
with heart disease and lung failure for lack of /[(any specific|a)] nationally recognized category.
I thought she may have been short for conversation/[(|, pulling my leg|, pulling the leg of /[(this|your)] poor foreigner)]. But no, it was true, and need only be evidenced by 
the ambulances and the haunting hollering of the dogs, /[(followed of course|followed quite sharply and abruptly to the /[(key|octave)])] by the hollering of their owners/[(|,|, a /[(|venerable)] /[(choral|choir)] /[(|or a fugue)] in C)] on what
seemed like every other sunday somewhere in our building. /[(|/[(T|As per your intuition, t|As you'd expect, t|Of course t|And t)]hey didn't play nicely, not together - and /[(success for the uncoordinated | for success the uncoordinated need only attain a certain number that much more than the other to make one a bit uneasy about the whole thing. | need only require a certain numbers no than more /[(|than)] twice greater than the /[(|numbers on the)] /[(other|opposing)] side)]
/[(So we|We)] held our breath and covered our ears outside whilst praying for those trampled underfoot - as the worse
was yet to come for them/[(. And|, and)] the fire department was never quite quick enough; once they ran through several more red 
lights than usual/[(, at a dizzying pace)], taking dozens /[(of folks|at a time)] underneath them in response. The mayor called it the most courageous /[(thing|gesture|act)] he'd ever 
witnessed /[(-|.)] For the many more live's /[(they'd|the driver'd|the medics and the driver'd)] saved/[(.|,)] I'd tend to agree. And forgive me, for /[(if I were to do different|if /[(|I were)] forced to do different)] I'd go faster. Such was the painful irony of this oft occuring madness.
/[(/[(And Once|Once)] you'd seen one of these Infestivals,|But it could all be prevented if only we'd just do what we were told  the Conventional Wisdom was etched into the mind forever: 

    'Just Cover The /[(|Bloody)] Hole And Force The Moth*********'s Through The Cracks In The /[(Floorboard | Hardwood floors)]/[(| - /[(the kids grew up quick exposed to such high vulgarity|the kids grew up quickly for sure/[(|s)]|yes, the kids they grow up quick)], but of course what child isn't already accustomed to that sort of language /[(|? I and my kinder gardening peers were /[(all:|so)> ><] well versed in curses /[(|:such so)] that we were /[(|a /[(|merry)]:)] rotten /[(|:set of)] sailors - all 26 of us performing above the provincial standards for excellence.)]. What sort of ceilings do we build for ourselves, and our highly plastic /[(hence capable brains? Should we force the most complex thing we know of in this universe to turn|brains capable of nearly anything - if only they'd work together instead of turning)] a blind eye (especially) to our own fastidiousness and fallibility as care givers, and as the stewards of a culture - and of our own /[(looming extinction:::::|species)] - /[(::::must I remind you that we're a species|a species, that might I add)], that only recently stumbled /[(|blindly)] through the wilderness to /[(one day emerge /[(from it triumphantly, |triumphantly:::::)] | to /[(|:::::one day) discover such wonder like agriculture and building)]  / /[(/[(from it to invent the written language, the trumpet, the piano, various types of lenses, and the computer.

Which is not /[(foolish|stupid)] to say, for we /[(:knew they'd:|::know they'll::)] soon get us - /[(but /[(|up)] until then|at the very least)] we'd have time to /[(prepare:|spare)]   /[(|/[(:our|-- to prepare our)] wills and eat fatty foods with /[(|good)] friends and lovers; trying oh so very hard /[(pretending:::|to pretend)] like what we were /[(drinking|breathing|swimming in)] /[(:::wouldn't:::|wasn't gonna)] kill us /[(|- in the end|:::in the ending)])])].

- which, apparently as a whole is known to be a much greater rate limiting factor. I shuddered.  Suddenly the charm wore off.
I started to smell the fish and didn't like it. But still she tried to convince me that this was a whole lot better than 
anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
This was the first time that I'd here it, so powerful and full of pride like the roar of lion, /[(defending|in defence of)] his pride. 
It was to be my official welcome; she pointed to a spot out the window /[(with emphasis|dramitically)] /[(adding a| with a resounding)] 
flurry of expletives I half understood. /[(|And so)] I traced an arrow from /[(her lanky finger|that lanky finger of hers)] over the padded
cot, and past /[(the toilet of fully exposed plumbing | the toilet with it's plumbing fully exposed)] 
out through this bright and /[(brilliant | magnificent |brilliantly magnificent)] 12th story /[(|apartment)] window all the way to the peak of 
Ellis Island. One can/[(\'t help but| only)] dream-up images of a people not unlike ourselves, in a time
not unlike the present, without asking 'Where Had They Went?'. It was like they had all stood up for an 
instant and collapsed.
/[(And the mudd rippled like water. | Sending ripples of concetric circles through the mudd like a drop of rain in a still body of water.)]
I thought perhaps /[(just maybe|by chance)] we were built from the same stuff and /[(|that)] it followed /[(that|)] we
might carry /[(|with us)] /[(their essence|that essence|that same essence|their very essence|that very essence)] - along with their struggles, their debt, their hopes and dreams, and 
those tiny fragments of ineffable joy /[(scattered|sprinkled)>>and<] inbetween the rocks and buoys. 
Just what brand of apathy would they smoke and teach their children? Or were they all just happy, a content to journey a new beginning?
Squarely in the midst of a vivid experience, I tried /[(as best as I could)] /[(finding|to find)] myself amoungst the lines of the elderly, the graduates, the 
swindlers, the mothers tending to coughing children and their fathers - but I was interrupted /[(|once more|once again)]. Her 
pointed finger lowered to the exposed pipe /[(protruding|coming)] out from the floorboard 
; the one resembling the trunk of an old /[(oak|tree)] chopped waist high/[(|,)] and covered with moss. 
I'd be remiss, also, not to mention the matching green tub /[(right beside it | to left of it | just to the right of it)]. 
<<Those 'ill do ya. Another glass and cover that one with as large a condom as /[(possible /[(|if you can find one)]|you can find)]>>, she said crudely.
I had seen /[(the two | the pair | them)] before, no doubt. I wouldn't admit it to myself, or to 
anyone else /[(|had they asked|for that matter)], /[(that /[(this tub and toilet|the tub and toilet|this pair - the tub and toilet -)] /[(delighted me to no end|had /[(|really)] sold it for me|were all I liked|brought me joy /[(unlike any other|like no other)])]|they were /[(indeed the only reason why I liked the place.|quite frankly all that I liked about the place)])]. /[(Surely no /[(|other two|two other)] peices of porceleain would dare admit to such uniqueness, but these /[(did|two peices /[(did|pulled it off /[(- and /[(in bearing all /[(|/[(were|proved)] shameless)] - I was starry eyed and weepy /[(|I tell you)], the boys back home would either give me a good slog or join in the mysticism of it all | whilst bearing all they were shameless 'les deux 'taient nues')])])] did | Other peices of porcelain /[(wouldn't admit to such uniqueness.|didn't admit as much uniqueness /[(as these)])].  I knew /[(nothing|hardly anything)] of their origins/[(|, not really,)] but there could be no sane argument against the /[(hidden fact|hidden truth)]/[(,|.)] /[(/[(t|Quite simply t)]hese two objects|the two)] stood out and belonged together, inseperably /[(bound together| bound each-to-the-other|bound|tied together)] by a plumbing /[(|both)]seen and /[(out of sight|unseen)], 
/[(which made | making|and made|and I must say it made)] this narrow /[(|little)] corridor /[(|so)] much more than an enclosed space 
/[(littered|sparsley littered)] with the usual standing /[(sort|assortment)] of 
/[(|common,)]/[(modern, everday|modern-day)] 'necessities'. I felt at home - and they called out to me time and time again.
About as strongly as I imagine the earth does from /[(this|that)] /[(/[(distance /[(|above)]|elevation)] where I/[('d been|was)] thouroughly grounded)]. And as I stared straight down into 
the abyss I'll admit I had visions of a sort: open-eye hallucinations of a short round-bellied italian /[(|man)]
dressed in blue overalls who'd /[(spring up|leap|jump)] out from /[(|the mouth of)] this green pillar [...] and shake himself dry.
The culmination of some grand /[(movement or of a labourious effort|and labourious effort)], I'm sure. What ever it was, he was damp, spent, and wanted nothing more /[(but|than)] to collapse /[(on|to)] /[(|the floor)].
Of course I hadn't the stomach to be of much help. But I'd do what I could the minute he'd regained consciousness. /[(So as it goes, o|And so o|So o|O)]verlooking much of Manhattan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he 
could certainly do a hellofalot better -  /[(in the hopes|with the hope)] that these few /[(|words of)] encouragement plus the dim reality of
/[(just how far /[(this browser|his browser)] had /[(led him astray|led him awry)] | where his travels had led him,)]
would spark in him /[(|perhaps)] some sort of all-encompassing epiphany, /[(|/[(that would|that with which to)] orient /[(him|his person|M n his person|him and his person)] in space and time| recovering his previous orientation in space and time - for I knew too well he /[(couldn't|does not|didn't)] /[(exist|be)] here)], /[(|then perhaps he'd share /[(|with us)] his content. | /[(|the content of which|and one whose content of which)] /[(|just maybe)] perhaps he'd /[(/[(|be so gracious)] share|mention, to free my mind of /[(|all)] /[(|it's)] /[(|worry and)] prention/[(|s)], /[(because I was way too familiar|for I was all too familiar)] with what he was going through - and this life didn't permit one to ask such /[(|probing)] questions or allow us the time to seek the answer any way but superficially - and I needn't /[(have|let)] anyone else /[(|speak for me and)] be my witness that /[(there|in there|only /[(after having|in the moment I)] lent /[(my good eye|myself)] to a terrible aspect)] had I found the truth /[(to be severely punishing|, and was /[(/[(|severely)] punished for it | instantly reprimanded for having succeeded)]))]. A content that seemed to have so much importance yet was /[(|beyond my experience)] entirely imagined at best.
As others have said, 'What is life if /[(/[(should it|were it)] be)]/[(|left)] unexamined?'.
And surely an idea is just a sophisticated delusion /[(masaged gently, some more than others, before being
unleashed unto the world in physical form without dislaimer and or warrantee - and yes there is no consumer
protection, that would be wrong. For every drunkard to do a plank off the side of a building, consider it natural selection. It's only in the interest of a few that the game's currency is /[(|is two be)] set in /[(|large /[(stroke and [(brush /[*(|to make form of)] |brushes)]|brush strokes of)])] grandiose delusion /[(|that is,)] until we find something better /[(|to write atop the space of whatevers already there there; annotating the chaffe /[(|from the waste and there)] from the rest, burning a black canvas bright blue or whatever color we like -)]
making one new year/[(|s)](*[4]) resolution to "devote more time and energy to greater /[(thought and integrity|integrity of thought)]" come true, and use space left over to imagine and nurture delusions of /[(lofty|loftier)] ideals /[(in|with)] solace of mind and /[(|with)] a/[(|dash of|bit of)] daring infallibility.
The thought of the grinding heard was unbearable, but it wasn't my imagination.
Anyway,
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good
3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my friends - who were living in the 
worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
I /[(took|take)] no pleasure in this /[(|fact)].
Oh /[(and|but)] I should tell you about the area/[(| I live in)]!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live /[(3|4)] floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.



So /[(I guess|it looks like)] I've taken to potty humor. The sort that sees childhood heroes /[(/[(spring|jump out)>and<] | /[(jump up|jump up out)] | leap out | leap up out)]
from toilets /[(|as thought it were usual)]  - no wonder I've never /[(/[(|been able to)] /[('|'just)] got on with it already', so easily without hesitation (lol) | liked them | got on with those things)].
Call it therapy.
The story, though nasty, is no more disgusting than the shit I hear in the /[(|rat infested*)] streets.
Things I can't imagine,
The kind to make me sick of this city.
/[(|:I'm sure)] once these people find out what grinds me they /[(wont|wouldn't)] stop)]
/[/[(|even)] to anger me, /[(/[(|not)] /[(until|'till)])]|only when)>and<] I'm gone
/[(|for certain)]. /[(|/[(They're intent|Intending)] to drive the soul right out of me.)]
/[(T|I'm convinced t)]hey're worst than children; for playground politics were much kinder than this as far back as I remember
And this clown doesn't even know me, or that I'm writing about him, but he
/[( knows me like he knows himself| knows what I want| knows what I aspire to /[(|be)]| knows's all about me)>>,<].
I shouldn't want to be his friend, and I can't imagine I'd be able to hang with the others who nearly hurt themselves slapping down on the tables,
laughing out loud, and lining up again to clip their heads on the rotating fan above, and take a few more chandeliers so they wouldn't have to lie when they told others that they were daring and open minded. 
I assume they must have been in pain, but you wouldn't know it by their laughter - and I didn't think it was funny. But I was certainly concerned.
And I don't know whether he's psychic, stupid, devilish, Machiavellian  or just bloody annoying - feeling a bit like I've exerted too energy on this matter already.
I'm sure there were much less fortunate targets out there in the world for him to deride.
And quite frankly, he didn't cross my mind twice unless he made his way in by force, with that voice that pierced through noise cancelling headphones
As you can imagine I was getting uncomfortable.
By my estimation /[(there was no way to persuade him end it.| theres nothing I could say.)]
So I went over there and told him to end it, and the situation quickly escalated. No wait, that didn't happen.
Oh but imagine if it did...oi, I could feel my freedom slipping away from me so very quickly.
With that in mind, I'd sooner let him win. Unless of course, it was my freedom he wanted.
He followed me everywhere it seemed, and I couldn't get a moments silence to do what I needed. 
There's not too much freedom there is there? Oh but there is.
And there I was with no job, no apartment, late assignments, research 
/[(projects|papers)><] past due, living in some temporary rat hole (that really was too nice to me),
with nowhere to go /[(::|on christmas:)] and no family or /[(:any|:: )] kind words to comfort 
/[(|me /[(|when I was sick and lonely /[(|::on christmas day)])]|::on christmas /[(|day)])] that year, still the villain;
seeking a little peace here and there, just to be done with my then current preoccupation for good, to finish the stale vanilla strawberry milkshake I'd kept in my bag for several weeks
; to enjoy /[(|modest|a very shy|a kind of)] poverty that would silence at least some of my detractors for good.
Did I mention that I'm losing my hearing? Perfect.
