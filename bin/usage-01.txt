- then it hit me, every story I'd ever /[(heard|read)] was exactly the same. You'd think I'd be outraged
But no, I wasn't bothered, how could I be? Besides the devil's in the details, 
and boy that /[(guy| m************r)]'s a drama queen. /[(I swear to god it|I swear it|It)]'s every little thing 
with /[(this guy|him)], you won't hear the end of it - nor should you if the pages fall 
anywhere short of inspiring /[(and|or)] insightful. Your internal workings are adaptive but simple, and while
/[(there may be great satisfaction in winning|it imay feel great to win)] big games against less trained
competition - in the end you aren't doing yourself any favors, only them.


Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|gawd awful)]
time trying to /[(figure out|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring 
/[(characters|people)] into a scene, kick them out, and have others /[(|just)] pass through 
/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader. /[(|Cuz n|N)]o bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their 
"hopped" up on caffeine, no. Silly bunnies,when caught with /[(the substance|caffeine)] they claimed dislexia 
/[(and were even more exited when they got off.|- and got off.)]


....
As we made our way through what /[(|had just:|::just::)] minutes ago /[(:officially became my apartment|::had officially become my apartment)], I was thouroughly briefed
to make sure /[(that during my time there I'd keep within|my time there would not conflict with|my stay would stay within)] the rules /[(outlined by some 'body of governance', who took themselves very seriously | outlined by some 'body of governance', who took themselves quite seriously| by the governance of the building|of the building)]. 
/[(To be honest, if I ever cared to break the rules|I figured if I ever cared to break the rules|Not one for facist dictatorship I swore to myself)] I'd consult the accompanying documentation /[(to lead my actions in accordance with the law that'd probably see me do years if not more for something like indescent exposure whilst painting over the walls in main corridor, the lobby, and reception.)]. For this encyclopedia they had spent a good amount of 
the money they had alotted for the quarterly budget - The very same budget that would inevitably be exceeded 
because of market forces beyond their control: too many residents wanted in and /[(a number nearly the same left to live elsewhere without notice or even a goodbye.|nearly the same number wanted out.)]:
I wont go into great depth about the depth of my disdain for their hubris or whatever it was that led them to be
so foolish but as you can imagine I
retreated into /[(deep unstructured thought|a standing state of::)] /[(::antipathy|::slumber)>and<])], /[(|and)] /[(oh and how he walked|how he walked)> <] (*[3]) (/[(as well|as swell)>and<](*[2]) as 
any other) /[(|could or has ever done)].
Half alert and barely awake, somewhere after her /[(|stern)] warning to me that I <<MOST CERTAINLY>> /[(WAS NOT|WEREN'T)] TO <<PAINT THE WALLS>>,
/[(I was struck with a sudden worry that the lengthy elevator up (and down) would prove too much. 2 minutes both ways, everyday, sometimes twice, lets say - /[(|Oi Vey -)] | I began to wonder whether I'd be able to stomach the long elevaor up.)].
Just then, a sharp whistle broke through my /[(thinking|thoughts)] /[(/[(of|to)] which I /[(|of course)] took notice |requesting that I take notice)] 
/[(|Take:)] /[(|:greater:)] /[(: ::|:notice of:::)]  /[(:: |:::this::::)] /[(|::::freckled)] lady (*). 
/[(|The landlady:)] /[(:looked impatient::|:was)] /[(|::with me)] tapping away /[(|incessantly)])] at the bottom 
of /[(this large|a large|a)] crystal mug /[(that sat alone in the middle of the sink|sitting in the middle of the sink)]. 
<<Did you hear what I just said?>>   
No.
<<Huh? ugh...there's a dishwasher, isn't there?>>
<<Like I said, only take this off when your washing up. There's some spray underneath in case you need.>>
I had no idea what she was talking about /[(.:|, of course, and::)] I had given myself away /[(:, of course.|::.)]
That I wasn't "from here" was /[(|now)] clear.  Oh, and she laaaaaaaaaauuuuuugggghed! /[(She laughed l|L)]ike she always does, at every new
immigrant and import to the city where the rodents outnumber the /[(population|populace)] tenfold in every alley 
/[(|,corner, creek, and crevice - that is, nearly ever locale, enclave, and bourough /[(in proximity|within appreciable distance)] /[(|to anything /[(|and everything)] of worth in this city)] was infested!  How they /[(/[(|ever )]manage/[(d|)] |continue still)] to cover up the fact /[(it|, that the infestation)] had become the cities 
third leading cause /[(for|of)] /[(hospitalization|hospitalization and/or death|death)], I don't know.  I met a nurse who claimed they'd often couple 
it with heart disease and lung failure for lack of /[(any specific|a)] nationally recognized category.
I thought she may have been short for conversation/[(|, pulling my leg|, pulling the leg of /[(this|your)] poor foreigner)]. But no, it was true, and need only be evidenced by 
the ambulances and the haunting hollering of the dogs, /[(followed of course|followed quite sharply and abruptly to the /[(key|octave)])] by the hollering of their owners/[(|,|, a /[(|venerable)] /[(choral|choir)] /[(|or a fugue)] in C)] on what
seemed like every other sunday somewhere in our building. /[(|/[(T|As per your intuition, t|As you'd expect, t|Of course t|And t)]hey didn't play nicely, not together - and /[(success for the uncoordinated | for success the uncoordinated need only attain a certain number that much more than the other to make one a bit uneasy about the whole thing. | need only require a certain numbers no than more /[(|than)] twice greater than the /[(|numbers on the)] /[(other|opposing)] side)]
/[(So we|We)] held our breath and covered our ears outside whilst praying for those trampled underfoot - as the worse
was yet to come for them/[(. And|, and)] the fire department was never quite quick enough; once they ran through several more red 
lights than usual/[(, at a dizzying pace)], taking dozens /[(of folks|at a time)] underneath them in response. The mayor called it the most courageous /[(thing|gesture|act)] he'd ever 
witnessed /[(-|.)] For the many more live's /[(they'd|the driver'd|the medics and the driver'd)] saved/[(.|,)] I'd tend to agree. And forgive me, for /[(if I were to do different|if /[(|I were)] forced to do different)] I'd go faster. Such was the painful irony of this oft occuring madness.
/[(/[(And Once|Once)] you'd seen one of these Infestivals,|But it could all be prevented if only we'd just do what we were told  the Conventional Wisdom was etched into the mind forever: 
'Just Cover The /[(|Bloody)] Hole And Force The Moth*********'s Through The Cracks In The /[(Floorboard | Hardwood floors)]/[(| - /[(the kids grew up quick|the kids grew up quickly for sure|yes, the kids they grow up quick)], but of course what child isn't already accustomed to that sort of language at a young age. Its my opinion that all the arguments against it boldly mock the widely held belief in the existence of a highly plastic /[(and therefore capable brain|brain capable of nearly anything)], turning a blind eye especially to our own fastidiousness and fallibility as care givers and as stewards of the culture to which we belong, and of our species - a species, that might I add, only recently stumbled through the wilderness to one day emerge from it /[(who in spite of their gifts|triumphantly /[(to invent the written language, the trumpet, the piano, and the telescope, and then the computer but yet /[(despite|in spite of)] their /[(|obvious)] gifts)] lacked a certain something to prevent us from becoming inept custodians of a planet that /[([(|may actually|might in ernest|may actually)] wish we had never existed|that would gladly choose the dinosaurs over us)], and believe me it wasn't for lack of political correctness or table etiquette, instead  having everything to do with our choice not to be mindful of this planet and of how lucky we are to be in such a temporary relationship with this beautiful earth, and everything else.)] So as we in the city would say to eachother, in the /[(|dank)] halls of our building, /[(at the office|in the office towers)], and to our children 'Just cover the bloody hole and force the motherfuckers through those infetissimal openings in the floorboards' and /[(though|sure)] they'd soon get us - /[(|but until then)] we'd have time to /[(prepare|spare)]   /[(|-- and share perhaps with a good friend over coffee; trying very hard to pretend like what we were drinking wasn't gonna kill us /[(|- in the end)])].
- which, apparently as a whole is known to be a much greater rate limiting factor. I shuddered.  Suddenly the charm wore off.
I started to smell the fish and didn't like it. But still she tried to convince me that this was a whole lot better than 
anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
This was the first time that I'd here it, so powerful and full of pride like the roar of lion, /[(defending|in defence of)] his pride. 
It was to be my official welcome; she pointed to a spot out the window /[(with emphasis|dramitically)] /[(adding a| with a resounding)] 
flurry of expletives I half understood. /[(|And so)] I traced an arrow from /[(her lanky finger|that lanky finger of hers)] over the padded
cot, and past /[(the toilet of fully exposed plumbing | the toilet with it's plumbing fully exposed)] 
out through this bright and /[(brilliant | magnificent |brilliantly magnificent)] 12th story /[(|apartment)] window all the way to the peak of 
Ellis Island. One can/[(\'t help but| only)] dream-up images of a people not unlike ourselves, in a time
not unlike the present, without asking 'Where Had They Went?'. It was like they had all stood up for an 
instant and collapsed.
/[(And the mudd rippled like water. | Sending ripples of concetric circles through the mudd like a drop of rain in a still body of water.)]
I thought perhaps /[(just maybe|by chance)] we were built from the same stuff and /[(|that)] it followed /[(that|)] we
might carry /[(|with us)] /[(their essence|that essence|that same essence|their very essence|that very essence)] - along with their struggles, their debt, their hopes and dreams, and 
those tiny fragments of ineffable joy /[(scattered|sprinkled)>>and<] inbetween the rocks and buoys. 
Just what brand of apathy would they smoke and teach their children? Or were they all just happy, a content to journey a new beginning?
Squarely in the midst of a vivid experience, I tried /[(as best as I could)] /[(finding|to find)] myself amoungst the lines of the elderly, the graduates, the 
swindlers, the mothers tending to coughing children and their fathers - but I was interrupted /[(|once more|once again)]. Her 
pointed finger lowered to the exposed pipe /[(protruding|coming)] out from the floorboard 
; the one resembling the trunk of an old /[(oak|tree)] chopped waist high/[(|,)] and covered with moss. 
I'd be remiss, also, not to mention the matching green tub /[(right beside it | to left of it | just to the right of it)]. 
<<Those 'ill do ya. Another glass and cover that one with as large a condom as /[(possible /[(|if you can find one)]|you can find)]>>, she said crudely.
I had seen /[(the two | the pair | them)] before, no doubt. I wouldn't admit it to myself, or to 
anyone else /[(|had they asked|for that matter)], /[(that /[(this tub and toilet|the tub and toilet|this pair - the tub and toilet -)] /[(delighted me to no end|had /[(|really)] sold it for me|were all I liked|brought me joy /[(unlike any other|like no other)])]|they were /[(indeed the only reason why I liked the place.|quite frankly all that I liked about the place)])]. /[(Surely no /[(|other two|two other)] peices of porceleain would dare admit to such uniqueness, but these /[(did|two peices /[(did|pulled it off /[(- and /[(in bearing all /[(|/[(were|proved)] shameless)] - I was starry eyed and weepy /[(|I tell you)], the boys back home would either give me a good slog or join in the mysticism of it all | whilst bearing all they were shameless 'les deux 'taient nues')])])] did | Other peices of porcelain /[(wouldn't admit to such uniqueness.|didn't admit as much uniqueness /[(as these)])].  I knew /[(nothing|hardly anything)] of their origins/[(|, not really,)] but there could be no sane argument against the /[(hidden fact|hidden truth)]/[(,|.)] /[(/[(t|Quite simply t)]hese two objects|the two)] stood out and belonged together, inseperably /[(bound together| bound each-to-the-other|bound|tied together)] by a plumbing /[(|both)]seen and /[(out of sight|unseen)], 
/[(which made | making|and made|and I must say it made)] this narrow /[(|little)] corridor /[(|so)] much more than an enclosed space 
/[(littered|sparsley littered)] with the usual standing /[(sort|assortment)] of 
/[(|common,)]/[(modern, everday|modern-day)] 'necessities'. I felt at home - and they called out to me time and time again.
About as strongly as I imagine the earth does from /[(this|that)] /[(/[(distance /[(|above)]|elevation)] where I/[('d been|was)] thouroughly grounded)]. And as I stared straight down into 
the abyss I'll admit I had visions of a sort: open-eye hallucinations of a short round-bellied italian /[(|man)]
dressed in blue overalls who'd /[(spring up|leap|jump)] out from /[(|the mouth of)] this green pillar [...] and shake himself dry.
The culmination of some grand /[(movement or of a labourious effort|and labourious effort)], I'm sure. What ever it was, he was damp, spent, and wanted nothing more /[(but|than)] to collapse /[(on|to)] /[(|the floor)].
Of course I hadn't the stomach to be of much help. But I'd do what I could the minute he'd regained consciousness. /[(So as it goes, o|And so o|So o|O)]verlooking much of Manhattan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he 
could certainly do a hellofalot better -  /[(in the hopes|with the hope)] that these few /[(|words of)] encouragement plus the dim reality of
/[(just how far /[(this browser|his browser)] had /[(led him astray|led him awry)] | where his travels had led him,)]
would spark in him /[(|perhaps)] some sort of all-encompassing epiphany, /[(|/[(that would|that with which to)] orient /[(him|his person|M n his person|him and his person)] in space and time| recovering his previous orientation in space and time - for I knew too well he /[(couldn't|does not|didn't)] /[(exist|be)] here)], /[(|then perhaps he'd share /[(|with us)] his content. | /[(|the content of which|and one whose content of which)] /[(|just maybe)] perhaps he'd /[(/[(|be so gracious)] share|mention, to free my mind of /[(|all)] /[(|it's)] /[(|worry and)] prention/[(|s)], /[(because I was way too familiar|for I was all too familiar)] with what he was going through - and this life didn't permit one to ask such /[(|probing)] questions or allow us the time to seek the answer any way but superficially - and I needn't /[(have|let)] anyone else /[(|speak for me and)] be my witness that /[(there|in there|only /[(after having|in the moment I)] lent /[(my good eye|myself)] to a terrible aspect)] had I found the truth /[(to be severely punishing|, and was /[(/[(|severely)] punished for it | instantly reprimanded for having succeeded)]))]. A content that seemed to have so much importance yet was /[(|beyond my experience)] entirely imagined at best.
As others have said, 'What is life if /[(/[(should it|were it)] be)]/[(|left)] unexamined?'.
And surely an idea is just a sophisticated delusion /[(masaged gently, some more than others, before being
unleashed unto the world in physical form without dislaimer and or warrantee - and yes there is no consumer
protection, that would be wrong. For every drunkard to do a plank off the side of a building, consider it natural selection. It's only in the interest of a few that the game's currency is /[(|is two be)] set in /[(|large /[(stroke and [(brush /[*(|to make form of)] |brushes)]|brush strokes of)])] grandiose delusion /[(|that is,)] until we find something better /[(|to write atop the space of whatevers already there there; annotating the chaffe /[(|from the waste and there)] from the rest, burning a black canvas bright blue or whatever color we like -)]
making one new year/[(|s)](*[4]) resolution to "devote more time and energy to greater /[(thought and integrity|integrity of thought)]" come true, and use space left over to imagine and nurture delusions of /[(lofty|loftier)] ideals /[(in|with)] solace of mind and /[(|with)] a/[(|dash of|bit of)] daring infallibility.
The thought of the grinding heard was unbearable, but it wasn't my imagination.
Anyway,
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good
3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my friends - who were living in the 
worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
I /[(took|take)] no pleasure in this /[(|fact)].
Oh /[(and|but)] I should tell you about the area/[(| I live in)]!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live /[(3|4)] floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.



So /[(I guess|it looks like)] I've taken to potty humor. The sort that sees childhood heroes /[(/[(spring|jump out)>and<] | /[(jump up|jump up out)] | leap out | leap up out)]
from toilets /[(|as thought it were usual)]  - no wonder I've never /[(/[('|'just)] got on with it already', so easily without hesitation (lol) | liked them | got on with those things)].
This is my therapy.
The story, though nasty, is no more disgusting /[(than most whats spoken in /[(|and about these /[(|grimy)]|these /[(|grimy|grime and*)] | the)] | than the shit I hear in the)] /[(|rat infested*)] streets.
Things I can't imagine,
The kind to make me sick of this city, then suddenly I'm gripped with fear. Cuz  /[(I fear|oh dear:)>,<], 
/[(|:I'm sure)] once these people find out what grinds me,
/[(I'm sure it'll never end|they /[(wont|wouldn't)] stop)]
/[(until|to please me until|/[(|even)] to anger me, /[(/[(|not)] /[(until|'till)])]|only when)>and<]<-[5] I'm gone
/[(|for certain)]. /[(|/[(They're intent|Intending)] to drive the soul right out of me.)]
/[(T|I'm convinced t)]hey're worst than children; for playground politics are much kinder than 
/[(this shit|the real thing /[(|in this REAL world)] /[(|-)])] and far more just by comparison. 
And this idiot doesn't even know me, or that I'm writing about him, but he
/[( knows me like he knows himself| knows what I want| knows what I aspire to /[(|be)]| knows's all about me)>>,<]
- /[(burn the bastard|to hell with him)] and /[(the|those)] idiots that listen
/[(|for)] whether it/[('s really| really is)] /[(some|an|their|his)] honest belief in /[(their|his)] own
psychic ability, /[(|the /[(|true)] virtue of/[(| their)])] dirt/[(|y)] politics, or /[(|just)]
/[(|/[(plain|unfounded)> <])] jealousy
I dont care - <<just leave me/[(|/[(|why wont you:|here)><]/[(:|, in peace)])]>> I swear. /[(|But)] He wont. 
/[(And|/[(Because he's stubborn|Bloody stubborn)] and proud of it, he's a Leo, you know. See I /[(|do)] listen /[(|moreoften|more often)] and by my estimation)] /[(there's no way to persuade him | theres nothing to say)]
Cause to him /[(its a game and this|it's a game, and this some sort of|this is some sort of)>><] competition he can win,
/[(|/[(|and)] /[(in that respect:|with all respect)])] 
/[(:he's|it)]/[(: /[(probably)] right|'s the only one| maybe the only one|'s probably the only one)] 
-- I'll give him points for /[(|that|knowing THAT, then take them all away for not knowing /[(when to stop|when he's won)])].

And if I'd tip 15%/[(; 15 percent of this shitty coffee |,)] with no job, no apartment, late assignments, research 
/[(projects|papers)><] past due, living in some temporary rat hole (that really is too nice to me),
with nowhere to go /[(::|on christmas:)] and no family or /[(:any|:: )] kind words to comfort 
/[(|me /[(|in my lonely /[(|::on christmas day)])]|::on christmas /[(|day)])], /[(|I'll still be the villain)];
seeking a little peace here and there, /[(if I'm ever to|so that I could|so that I'd|to)] /[(finish|be done with)] this shit and
enjoy /[(|a very shy|a kind of)] poverty /[(:|alone, ::)] with half the worry and noise to /[(:accompany it|::bother me)].
Did I mention that I'm losing my hearing? Perfect.

Oops, I think Ii found another personal use for this! If we're to consider how to arrange the elements of an alteration:
their precendence, their independance, their directional compositions if joined together (accross)

Mmmmmm....did you feel that? It's not what you think (if its dirty). /[(more reason|we)> <] needa finish this. There it was again...oh JOY (not to be confused with oggi or ochio - good grief charlie brown...).
