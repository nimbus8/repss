It may have been the smartest thing to be done at the time, etched into our collective subconscious was that final dot, /[(*|clear as day,)] to cement and mark the period/[(*| /[(especially the end of it | by the end)])]. It were poetry /[(|, no less)] - the  old man reminisced/[(|, poetry /[(being somewhat akin to wine | *was like wine /[(in that | and in this particular instance)])] it calmed and remediated our tension - it was the only way the community could move /[(|on to accept | forward from)] it.  /[(The man across the aisle sitting in a quiet manner mimicking the old man's posture, taking it all on, appreciated, pensive, and only a tiny bit skeptical he asked <<These workers, had they ever considered the person below /[(to | might)] be a traitor?>> 
The old man surprised at the question scratched his head and gathered his thoughts. Alas, he finally responded, <<I think it was important not to loose to sight of the image of a person suddenly overcome with perspective; this were in a time when the old ideas of sage wisdom had been tossed aside -- thrown downstream for whatever was it was that were trendy for a while that we're just now beginning to see as pure nonsense -- but only as new uninhibited science begins to discount the bad habits we'd picked up in the laziness of comfort, the truth unfortunately hurts, and it keeps on hurting so long as you don't welcome change with open arms.>>
<<Sorry, you know, don't mistake this impoliteness, I don't know where you're going with this -- but I can tell you that I'm not interested in any sort of church, or a doctrine -- especially one that advocates this whole nonsense where we should fall into each others arms and off tall buildings thinking someone might catch us, or that a God would always divert his attention away from everything for that instant to catch us as he let others fall, it was this kind of logic that gives way to so much of whats wrong with the world nowadays;  the western world was superficial it thought that pure aesthetic and a history of forgetting and being ignorant would be reason enough for him to save us and our families from peril as it had abject poverty; we cried as our brothers and sisters were deployed overseas into war | we sent out troops over there)], but in our minds we felt an overriding sense of calm, thankful for our comparative wealth, thankful for the IMF, thankful that the charter of rights of freedoms didn't extend beyond our borders, praying to God only when we needed something special in our lives to upset the boredom, or escape some imagined danger that prowled the streets at night in the safest city in the world -- separate from the bombings and the unheard death count that had interrupted the lively discourse and wide eye enthusiasm of a people who thought they might at once be done with famines, foreign occupation, government by proxy, and bloody civil wars -- ignorant of their enemies apathy towards them; the enemies who, unlike them, were brought up on games like Risk and Monopoly /[(|as children, )]  and therefore thought erroneously that life was a game of domination and suppression, this image of the ebb and flow of how things work were all they had in ways of a philosophy - and at night they thanked God /[(he | for the fact he sure as hell)] wasn't looking after all of us the same! >>
He had worked himself into a stupor, rocking to and fro much harder, he curled and pressed his toes down deep in his /[(*|open)] sandals. /[(Both his feet went | his feet began to)] numb, and the old man let this, being old and open to /[(experiences | the experiences and feelings of others, he saw the young man of nearly thirty had nearly given up all hope)]. 
The old man took no time to think about what he was going to say, the younger resident in all his feverish exhalations - took the old man to a time when he where that /[(| passionate | impassioned)] about what he considered right and wrong; the latter end being the warehouses other peoples' ineptitude, overpacked as it seemed. In this manner he was right, but because he was young /[(|and inexperienced /[(|going into his thirties)])] he didn't consider he /[(|may have been)]  sorely misguided.
Here he thought he could help the troubled boy, so he began, <<You need only encounter an old african man in the place where he frequented /[(more|most)] often; seemingly possessed while in the throws of a chillingly silent meditation -- to understand the power of experiences/[(|some call nightmares)] as you wandered about the forest, alone, for whatever reason, imagine this is a dream /[(*|out of order)]: imagine that he tells you that there is a state of conscious in /[(*|*|this)] existence, /[(it is | borne)] of communal living and of the unavoidable interconnectedness of things and people across generations - few things were novel, we've taken out so many books that already there are those who've /[(glimpsed the fullness of understanding | understood that you can't have understood everything)].  Still others like yourself /[(|,more those you speak of,)] have sorely trailed behind dispassionately. Don't take offence my friend, I don't excuse you for youth, and until your worthy of another classification I will lump you as you have others into the /[(mountain 'thei' | pile of they)]. 'thei' knew exactly what they were doing when they perked up their ears to sound of an imaginary register. Their marked failure to comprehend their /[(only | own)] weakness, didn't stop them from exploiting those same weaknesses in others. /[(Going on | He continued)], that it were our differences that made us great, but it were /[(|also)] unfortunately this difference in combination with our self centredness that together translated into a tendency to care more for those who looked superficially like ourselves; and that we'd rarely treat ourselves so badly, so we'd sooner treat the other with immediate suspicion and disdain, forming groups that we might command or be /[(part | privy)] to a wild conspiracy. We latched onto irrationality as it were, wondering why it was others treated us badly when we never gave them a chance as an equal individual to begin with. This of course was ridiculous; to spend all ones day dreadful miserable and to expect someone to walk in onto that was cruel; but they figured that out by rolling with the punches, getting in a few jabs of their own, leveraging one poisonous interpersonal relationship after the other to garner favour and ascend further up the mountain - where they would be all powerful and immune perched at the apex - /[(|there'd be no reason to believe in a higher power because we couldn't see it; and if one had devoted himself to such an order it would only make sense to not believe in a higher power either as they ascended the mountain -- why, when it was their aspiration and their ability to imitate, run faster, and own things completely that mattered. To climb the mountain was to realize the mountain were just long pole, and it quite frankly it weren't immediately obvious to anybody that the technique couldn't be less inspired, all one had to do was take word for word the sometimes erroneous diatribe of people who spoke to us in a particular tone. It was a particular talent that required a very special ear and sense of purpose, and only a few very special people knew the trick to -- they were like magicians hoarding some grand secret; and I the man you see before you, had been a boy once too, swimming with ease ease in a lake of immaturity. With that said, because it were a trick -- trick being a word coined by the unknowing and the know-it-alls  to refer to a learned talent that went/[/[(|along)] hand in hand with sacrifice | hand in hand alone alongside sacrifice)].  Anything that could be learned could be lost and regained or enhanced by practice -- so that there being many levels of special above incapable. Strangely enough - or aptly, depending on your mood - the level immediately greater nowhere near the highest was ironically the hardest to break past, mostly because most see enough immediate benefit, and in their immaturity see little need to keep aiming higher from where they stood several feet taller above a pile a garbage wondering if it were possible to get away less handwork and more vacation, but weren't so foolish /[(|even if they were suffering near sightedness -- they saw only the spanning landscape of some great lake and imagined /[(aurora borealis flickering across it's surface, uninterested that someone experiencing in the flesh might have done better to borrow their image /[(|in place of it)]. And it were unfortunate to say the least, because what they'd gain in breaking past that barrier, were not just appreciable as paintings, but as complete understanding of all that weren't, which was as good as they were gonna get. Knowing everything was dangerous, it gave one little time to know oneself. But knowing what was impossible allowed time for introspection, bullshit, purple rain, and peanut butter stains all over /[(|leather)] couches only meant that you were capable of navigating the waters more efficiently without a compass.

Madame Gregory made sure to stare the child down as she walked the walk of shame up to the front of the class, /[(|where

  <<If the boy were to trade all his apples /[(|*in)] for oranges, he'd have 63 oranges.>>
/[(|Gloria looked /[(|back)] at Madame Gregory expecting her to either correct what she had done or allow her to

given a better answer than she had /[(| herself written down in her notes. The notes she had copied /[(rote

The schoolmaster was unmoved. She took a very cold and academic approach to emotion and feeling. Instead 
/[(:|of feeling badly::)] she did what she always did when the world urged /[(::her to care | :her to feel /[(badly

the schoolmaster was right; it was incredably disrespectful of her to doze off in  /[(|the middle of)] class, she wouldn't have
liked it done to her. So she took the schoolmaster's advice and /[(threw her empurpled whiteboard in the dumpster behind her

Footenotes:
 [Emp1]
   - I feel I must add here that when Gloria resigned to the idea of leaving her empurpled whiteboard at home 
     (the work of art that it was), because there would be no use for it in a place of learning, Gloria was being 
     optimistic. For the idea /[(that school was a place of learning, and not | of school as being more than)] just 
     some godforsaken daycare centre, was so important to her /[(sense of | emotional)] well being, that she had to admit
     that /[(this|the former)] idea was valid - and that it justified making sacrifices. Furthermore it held both in general,
     and in light of her own particular situation. But, that it was valid, /[(|also)] meant that it were at least provably true,
     and that there was at least some hope, that even /[(when|*if)] things were bad, /[(*things | they)] could always /[(change for the | get)]
     better. If it weren't the case, by this definition of validity, she would have surely ran away - /[(*|*|taking her empurpled

adds too much complexity to what most of the time is already very dubious and disdainful material - I don't even have 
to mention the medium to get my point accross. It's instantaneous. I believe that our unconcscious minds appreciates the
finer details in a much more holistic and all encompassing fashion - we weren't meant to be so much in control after all,
they said, what would this little boy do if he had all the time in the world? - than what inevitably bubbles up to the surface
of thinking and the analysess performed therein (and for the unimaginative: the pessisism towards all things to which these people
are moreoften than average beholden too (maybe even for that reason alone (if so I wouldn't trust them or their opinion)) is but a a drop in bucket - a bucket

in the world could conjure between the ears of child who feared everything - but still, for whatever reason, whether it was bravery or stupidity, in his
mind it were a mix of both to begin, and this feeling remained after he got on; his harness fixed tightly over his shoulders, arms and legs daggling in 
the air suspended several hundred meters above the ground - initially - a sharp pinch is felt all over and he just wants to fall and
get it over with (it could have been the biting of the wind as it periodically slapped him /[(in every direction | every which way with frostbite)] or just
his nerves getting the better of him /[(*|wanting to know what free fall felt like, when one opening the chute, and it flew away from them,

feel even that? The more he thought about it, the more he accepted certain truths about life misinterpreted in the heat of the moment, and
in restrospect all the way up to that moment. He tried to seer those lessons into his mind, hoping that the action should prevent him
falling right there and then, that it would get him through the next two and half minutes unscathed and unbothered by the experience to
then be unleashed back onto the world, as he had it, to show how them all just how it was to truly live). 
    Parts of him /[(come | came)] /[(*|rushing)] in and out of feeling; he notices that he never quite feels numb all over, and he doesn't 
know if it's even /[(|at all)] possible that it should ever happen, <<What would numb then be?>> For a moment, with such a question, coming
to him like water through an open facet, he achieves (Zen | complete tranquility /[(*|whilst paralyzed by the difficulty of his wording, that

to him his mind is /[(occupied | concerned with a cacophony of laughter, jeers, and fleeting thoughts; the most interesting and maybe the most

on the of uneven and poorly maintained dirt roads they were sent to line with power cables and fiber optic chords. They are the casualties of progress - this
the next generation will undoubtedly say -- but still they're distrubered, and worse of all, the can't control it - unhappiness mixed in with
necessary periods of dream like states is all they know, so they work, and they conquer ever layer of sky and open space imaginable with walls that give off
that familiar low hum so that noone is ever confused with the concept of space, and everyone is loved superficially with likes and friend requests -
with more friends than people or even cockroaches, as our new virtual companies have overtaken them in their realness and imprtance,
shaping our habits and our biology with a runaway pace that'll continue all the way up to the point of the singularity, when we'll be able to 
make love to our avatars like we've always wanted - or, all those teeth forced loose would have been lost for nothing - god help the poor souls
who were enhanced with "dental implants"- those /[(*|two inch long)] metals /[(screws | nails)] they drilled down into your gums where noone might
see or ever suspect that one was different - that one had opted for a modification they'd forget and not fully realize the implications of until they
started the feel a cold needle tap against it's exterior in the hollowness that may only be found in the middle of nowhere, where the kinder folk often run about
their fields and frolick in broad daylight. If we knew anything of our objective reality, I might imagine that it may be so jarring that we would do anything we could to ignore it.
I once read a very serious book, it were enthralling, and captivating, quite unlike this passage from the beginning all the way to the end,
I devoured whole in one sitting - I didn't think it was possible. At the end of this book, the author states that what he was to write
in the last paragraph shouldn't be taken seriously. The next sentance starts off the next paragraph and it appears like the money suddenly
starts speaking unfiltered directly from the heart, this were the end of the novel. The climax and the aftermath were both fulfilling, he writes,
I agreed, the book - as I've already stated - was enthralling piece of somewhat modern litteratture that I devoured whole
without loss.The book itself, split into 5 volumes under one binding, was so inspiring, provocative, joyful, and lucid, that I
passed over quite innocently the grimness of this the first line of the ending paragraph. It had summed it all up.
Not wanting to plagarize this text, and seeing as how the once sentace spanned half the page, I will do it very little
justice and resort to overgeneralizations and commonly used platitudes to paraphrase it. It read, simply, that the author hoped the reader
would never have to read another book again, fearing that no one other would be so beutiful - he was right, 4 years not one has been so beutiful - and
because not one will ever pale in comparison to such awesomness, the read should stop reading, go outside, and
enjoy his or her life, while he or she still had so few little problems to worry about - and that if it hurts know, then the author knew
no better way to break it to the reader that it would hurt alot more once it's finally out. Imagine the needle and where it might go,
now multiply that pain by a thousand, and then you'd know. What a terrible ending.

I'm tired of hearing about how terrible of a writer I am. Look, I am the worst writer in the world, I know this.
I don't make it habit of deluding myself. But I do believe in the awesomely powerful capability of our brains.
To this point in our history we have undoubtedly underestimated it's prowess. Nature has done beutiful things 
since the precambrian period; between each of our ears exists the remnants of our evolution to this point. Goldfish
aren't known for their /[(brain/[(s | power)] | mental flexibility)>or<], imagine how small and limited in it's intended
function it must be. Do goldfish have attention spans? Do goldfish ever contemplate their lives, question their surroundings,
/[(*|make a fuss,)] go on hunger strikes in the hopes you'd buy them better quality food(organic, not that processed shit)?
Is there any sense in trying to make sense of the movements of a goldfish? Consider that I forget the 6th last thing I just thought,
without fail, unless I commit the 5th to memory before allowing other thoughts entry (a nice thought...). /[(Know that | I'm not
kidding)>><] this is a real example, yes I'm terrible; considering my god given ineptitude and considering the many layers of brain
and the ingrained currents that pulse from one neuron to another at speeds unimaginable; consider the size of my brain, consider
the size of a goldfish (not those mutant goldfishes with three eyes you find handing out around nuclear power plants, those
mother*****rs are seriously twisted, I've never seen such hairy arm/[(s|pits)], and they all got anchors /[(*as|for)] tattoos
like it were a right of passage when each one turned 18 in human years, and started given us serious competition in sports
like soccer and major league baseball (damn those left handed cross eyed bastards and they're incredibly long shl-).
Not those guys, I wouldn't be surprised if some hormonal teenager one day got carried away, we really shouldn't have bought Johnny a goldfish, what he really needed was a girlfriend.)




A friend of mine disdainfully peddled this /[(|half-baked)] rebuttal /[(my way | over in m direction)] with a certain
derision like 'Well, how do you know goldfish /[(just don't do | aren't just like)] that to throw you off/[(| a bit)]?'.
I shouldn't say this guy is a friend, no not all. He was an argument/[(|ative)] noise box/[(,|parading around as an impartial voice of reason)]
who took issue with near everything I said because he were a /[(couple of feet taller | full foot)] than I were.  I know
what your thinking, no that /[(can't | couldn't)] be the case. Hold that thought. Let's first examine his rebuttall/[(*
| in depth)]. He claimed that goldfish could in theory be putting /[(|on a bit of)] a front, refusing to do all the
things I would have expected from a dog had I instilled the fear of god in him, that if he hadn't done what I told him
I'd slap the little mutt so hard he come down with diabetes. Why diabetes? My backhand was /[(bittersweet | sweeter than
anything else I could imagine)] and the the spike flail that I /[(carried | wielded)] was /[(coated | covered)] with sugar
cubes /[(|in winter)]. Let's not forget the rhymestone dangling off my middle finger. When I say dangling, I mean it were
several sizes too large for my skinny middle finger so /[(|in effect)] it shuffled up and down freely, stopping at the 
joints /[(|which were /[(*|/[(*|then)] always)])] too swollen to allow /[(the thing | the ring)] proper passage)]. After
I had finished answering his first question, and let me preface that what I'm about to say next is strictly speculation -
not to be taken seriously - much like he was not be taken seriously, ever. But you know, he spoke with this even, unbothered,
/[(whining /[(drone | voice)] | droning voice)]/[(- a bit|;)] like he were handing down God's twelfth commandment
/[(*|*|to all us sinners)]. I would comment that his friends were /[(silly | foolish)>>even<] foolish to /[(stick with him |
have stuck with him for so long)], but the truth were, /[(unexpectedly | sadly)], that they were all lucky to have
him. Though he were every bit as shallow and guileless, not everything that came out of his mouth /[(could be ignored |
was horseshit)] - though a good percentage of it was, and nearly all the rest fell into the 'maybe…but I figure it's
so unlikely that to submit oneself to such an idea and believe it fully/[(|, and I don't actually believe you do,)]
puts one so far at odds with what most most would take for granted true (the near axioms that help /[(|us extrapolate
into the unknown, to)] shed light on our existence) that - okay, really?
  <<Well, Will, it just sounds to me like you don't know what your talking about.>>
Of course. (This is just a speculation) It wasn't the content of what I said, it were how I said it, and the for the
fact it came from anywhere but the peak of mt. everest (but from the dark/[(|, dense, /[(|and)] /[(|heavily)] forested)]
valleys of the Kilimanjaro, a man's /[(insight | judgement)> and <] was clouded by /[(|the /[(|eminent)] dangers of his
/[(environment | seen in his immediate surroundings)] | bush and one needed /[(|be suffering /[(|from)])] frostbite,
/[(standing very still | sitting still /[(|in place)] with one leg crossed over the other)], in place, utterly monotonous
in order to have a true perspective of how things work/[(, atop the mountain where |; at the peak of mount everest you'd)]
be forced to look down more often than you would at the clouds - /[(he saw | seeing)] everything as it were. While people
like me, the majority, taking our place somewhere between heaven and hell, we tired of staring all day at the ground so
often we looked to the /[(skies /[(*|for answers to our dire questions)] |* clouds. When I looked at the clouds, I saw 
ten different things at once, but only really six /[(concerned me | stood out to me as especially beautiful /[(*|and awe-inspiring)])]
- this to me were a phenomena I barely /[(|ever)] recognized, and I hope /[(|as well that it /[(:|too::)] might be /[(::true for you
/[(*|in this case)] |:too true)])], where the clouds took several three dimensional forms at once, as one focused nearer to and further
from it space, he /[(found | would find)] it horrendously interesting. I saw a good set of bordering locks of hair turned purple, as
desired to make oneself appear more interesting than they ever believed they were. This purple colouring of hair ran from the roots of
a friends scalp /[(|right)] down to the ends. But when did this happen exactly? It didn't. It hadn't been there before, earlier in the
evening, and it weren't there now. Of course it did, did it? I mean, it's there/[(*|- it's right there!)] I got up from my seat and
skipped around back to check that the /[(|qualities of this)] illusion was consistent/[(| from all angles)]. I'd reached two conclusions.
I'd reached them both at the same time at once, each scared the living daylights out of me. But I couldn't look away. My friend thought
it strange after a few odd minutes of scientific experimentation - thank you chemistry class, but how does chemistry explain this? I assured
my friend that, no, I hadn't suddenly fallen for him; he revolted me well as ever, /[(|he shouldn't doubt that ever in the future unless he's
change to be entirely unrecognizable, which begged to question he where a different person would it still be that I should be seeing what I was
seeing?)] I weren't about to go let a little thing like him being a bit uncomfortable get in the way of my experiments. After a longer period of
concentrated silence my thoughts fractured. And splintered in several perpendicular directions: where had I ever seen purple, it were so rare,
yet really it's definition encompassed a large band of frequencies. I looked to the sky, not for god, or for any /[(|good)] reason /[(|really)],
expecting blue /[(*|haphazardly)]/[(, though I don't | though I shouldn't)] know why as we were all sat in a cafe that hour, early in the morning,
even earlier as we arrived I had noted 'that these people', got up so early and looked /[(|so)] rather down; on a saturday there's little reason to
torture oneself so, they were all a group a masochists (I imagined them armed with machine guns, what a strange little convention this was, I laughed out loud).
/[(I searched for the sky m|M)]y gaze met with white panelling, browned at the edges with wear and freckled with what I suspected may have been
/[(mildew | something similar to the moss the grew on uneaten peanut butter sandwiches)]. Purplish! I think. Peanut butter sandwiches alone were
not enough, it needed sugar to fuel my already fervent hyperactivity,
  <<put /[(some | a little)] jam on that peanut butter,/[(|won't you?)]>> I said while the two boys from /[(school | my soccer team)] cowered behind me.
I was /[(|quickly)] /[(served a disconcerting look of /[(|unbelieving)], so I took it back /[((*|*|as soon as I could)] | reproached, in the unspoken
language every parent /[(has with their | developed with their /[(kin | cubs)] as they tried to simmer the wild beast/[(|s)] they feared would run straight

  <<And what do you say, young man?>>
  <<Gimme my goddamn Jelly /[(*|or I'll squeal like a potato)].>> My friends laughed/[(.
|, while)] I braced myself; knowing that I were /[(/[(|a brave, yet altogether /[(stranded | defenceless)], little boy)] all alone, with only the guarantee that
/[(that it wouldn't be long before I'd | I might)] exit, one way or the other, /[(|possibly in pieces if you keep that /[(|type behaviour)] up, I was told |,
several ways at once, as I'd be torn to  pieces, /[(somewhat like | something similar)] the piece of origami not quite good enough for the origami master,
maybe for his friends shut it at home who had lost all their sight long ago but still remained in spirits, and were very skilled as they folded a single
square of paper into a one legged sailor or whatever they fancied and could no see with two eyes. It were inspiring, hilarious, and proof that even as
tragedy strikes us we may still find pleasure in things unknown, and forever unseeable with two eyes; once the integrity of each our lenses had been

a red light turn green", /[(*|and it just kept on growing.)] I never knew just how to react to Mr. Stevens. He gave me the  impression he /[(had a refined
and whimsical | was harbouring a very /[(refined | sly)])] sense of humour behind that hard stoic/[(front|ism)] he had put up for most of everyone else.
We would go down to meet him, and it was here, I imagine, it all started. We sat down with Mr. Stevens and in his cabin made origami sea-urchins for six
hours each Sunday morning /[(|straight)] into the afternoon. As we left, I was handed a bag of fresh vegetables from our garden and a round 'mince' rye bread
that would last the /[(aging | old)] man /[(until we came: |* for as long as it took for us to come::)] back the following week/[(.| /[(::and|:to)] visit him.)]
  <<Thank/[(you, | the)] old man,>> he jeered as said goodbye and I sprinted away /[(|on out the door)] with my the set of origami /[(|see-urchins)] I had made
/[(|held)] close to my chest)] and struggling to close the door behind without dropping /[(any of my origami | a single origami see-urchen)] - /[(|and of course
I'd always drop at least one /[(|, and wasn't it the darndest thing, the next visit he'd always have found the one /[(|or two)] that I'd /[(dropped  | made and
had fallen from the /[(|shallow)] cup between my arms and chest)])])], giving it back to me, this time I'd remember carry it in my pockets. I don't know at what
point I started doing it on purpose. Doing so with the best of intentions, as it were his descriptions of the various differences in both our craft and methodology
that were truly interesting insights I'd sooner not miss. It were his almost mystical explanation of both out methods: the detailing, the fold, inflection points,
and bezelled curves, distinct to each of us that really got me wanting here more of what the man had to say. Had I not otherwise, I felt there were little else to
speak to him out about, not knowing what even what to ask, more specifically, what may have been appropriate, given his condition. I felt terribly about this, so 
I left behind a conversation starter.)] /[(On our way back up the hill each figure /[(|I'd crafted)] were picked up and discarded, once /[(/[(he | the my Granfather)]
said | every while /[(he'd | my Grandfather would)] /[(comment | say)>>and<])], <You know, this I like>>. I said nothing. There would nothing so much as an acknowledgment
even if I did. Ultimately I preferred this. We were family after all, more lake than we were different from the rest of the world around us. /[(If there /[(was|were)]
an answer, I'd be kept in the dark/[(|forever /[(*|left to feel my way through /[(*|the uncertain terrain, having only what was of note shown to me briefly before being

| there were nothing wrong with it, nothing wrong with any of them. Old man Stevens thought, at least, they were all interesting in their uniqueness. | Whatever defect there
was, not even he could explain it. It may have taken several forms all at once in his eyes, and none of them /[(struck him /[(|much)] like | seem to him embody)] a sea-urchin.
The more I am without him, the more I realize that this might very well be true. For the longest time I wanted to be something different, something other than the man who felt
the need spend half the walking day making purple origami sea-urchins every Sunday, then spend the whole afternoon flicking the damn things away into the bean stocks of our
nearest neighbours whose patch of land would better be described as several mispurposed football fields placed end-on-end by their widths. The neighbours would never say
anything, and I imagine even that the width most time carried the things off and away in the opposite direction right through the wide openings of their pickets - but still
I got haggled by the neighbour and soon he got his parents all worked up about it, where, this neighbour boy at the top of the hill was /[(throwing | pelting)] scraps of papers
all along our stocks. So for this I got several ear fulls when all alone unaccompanied. I got playful with the boys old man one day going to school, sticking a thumb in each ear
and blowing out my tongue at him. He came running down his porch at me, frightened I took towards the school house as fast as anything /[(|on two legs)]. For the first time I
arrived early in class, the teacher had already outlined on the board the lesson plan for the day. I didn't look. I thought about the old man chasing after me. For sure he was
playing, what would he /[(have done | do)] to me anyway that he could explain to my father?  Coincidentally I was hit from the back by a paper plane, it landed, I turned, and
gave a good stare of /[(|disapproval)] back at big Archy. The boys real name was Archibault, all I knew was that he was an ill tempered as any in the whole school, and was a
year older than most of our homeroom class that year. He looked back at me like, oh yeah what are you gonna do? I gave him a grimace this time, and went back to not paying attention.
The went by quickly, and soon the afternoon bells had gone off and off I were back home. We were moving that's all I knew, no, 'I' was moving. I was the one who gone through something
quite out the ordinary for a poor child his age, and I were the one staying with his grandparents out in the middle of nowhere. These were the best years of my life, arguably.
The simple life, /[(which I didn't know for quite some time | that I'd soon forget)], and hadn't figured until I had turned a man, then gained many years /[(of /[(|supposed)]
wisdom before I'd figure, indeed, /[(it | such a life)]|and nearly worn myself through, at which point I knew /[(|that)] the buzz, /[(and hustle, down in |hustle, and proximity,

of road I was travelling, coming out from the cover of white barked tree (one of many in the /[(forest of white barked trees|white barked forest)]). As soon as I saw him appear I

thing, but staying the staying the blasted child who'd roll around in the mudd and beat the snot out of a boy two years younger and half his size, that same jackass would /[(let go of

a mouthful of elbow)]. I growled too. Not feeling any pain I reached around with the hand closest his collar, which had lacked any of it's usual faculty despite being at the /[(end 
| extrem/[(e|a)])] of /[(|one|a)] limb in dire trauma; with a /[(good enough | full)] grip /[(|onto his collar)] I pulled rotated his collar clockwise down and /[(then all the way

in the area by his hips | taking a good chuck of the dogs fur with the other hand to assume control of both our destinies, I drove his hind legs into one another, using his momentum
against him as I slammed his backside heavily into in the dirt road. The dog let out a squeal, let go of my arm, and let up squealing looking distinctively crippled as he lay on his
back. I backed away, now scared, heart racing as I begin to notice a throbbing pain that I needn't reference with my eyes to know exactly what /[(|it looked like | what had been done)].
It were all so quick, and I figured I needed help, so I went back in the direction of the schoolhouse. Never twice looking back the sick old man after he let go of that /[(|damn)] leash.
The squealing continued and lessened only very slightly in the first few seconds as I hurried away in the opposite direction. After about 5 seconds, not nearly long enough for me to so
far that I'd stop wouldn't be able to hear him, or a gunshot, had it had happened, I would have heard that too, at that moment, not twenty meters away, the dog /[(just stopped | quieted)]. 
/[(|What was the quickest way to kill a dog without a gun? I think back and question /[(if | whether if truly)] I had not been /[(adversely affected | damaged)] by the incident. That night

I was /[(|technically still)] part of the family, and most /[(who attended and were | attending the funeral who claimed to be)] there for a particular reason, knew me as such.
I wanted to ignore their presence. I didn't know what to think; I didn't know what they would think of me, the other black sheep in /[(the | what appeared to be on the
surface a very terrible /[(*|extend)])] family. Thats why I had chosen a solitary spot in the corner of the Basilica to fix my gaze, never imagining /[(what would happen
| who would approach me)] immediately before the /[(service commenced | the funeral got started)]. The Basilica, now nearly three quarters filled with a collection of four
or five hundred people who /[(opted to slot themselves: | slotted themselves:)] under the categories of /[(:: |:either)]  friends, family, and /[(the last  | that last one
that we've mentioned,)] there for 'a particular reason'. This latter category formed the majority.  It's the group that I myself along with most who knew the man well - and then
those who knew him none at all but by his /[(|temperament | reputation | infamy)] - /[(|all)] had at least one foot firmly planted /[(|into)]. But we sat
all over the Basilica, not to hoard ourselves into something like the corner that I had been staring /[(|square)] into for the last 30 minutes. I felt a hand run across the
light padding atop my suit; a suit that I /[(may or may not have actually worn to my senior prom. | wouldn't dare admit to her was the suit I wore to my senior prom.)]
We struck up a conversation immediately. Enter Anya. Suddenly the mood of the event got brighter, the curtains were drawn /[(*|over the windows)], the lights of the Basilica's
podium flashed on/[(*|, and she began whispering something into my ears that reminded of two things. One - that in life we all have our anchors, and none threw them overboard.
In fact the anchor was only what we called it, the phenomena was completely at odds with nature - or perhaps just we thought of it. These anchors were the people /[(|present)] 
in each /[(of one|person)]'s formative periods over the course of his or her life. We had anchors in childhood as far back as we could remember, right up until maybe the period our teens;
then into young adulthood; then into whenever it was /[(that | we'd call the path)] we were working our way to the grave, and if we chose to make any other division other than death, then
that would be the way it goes -- I'd refuse to open any more seas than I could keep track of, for the ones that I already had were tearing me to pieces each with their pulling,  that life was never mine.
I knew men with 60 different C's open. That's Ridculous - I said, when I heard it, and he responded by saying <<Nuh Uh!>>. The bounds of these spaces were always different, lying on a continuum
as fine and uncountable as the many /[(|individual)] displacements along the shores of the cost/[(.|; as it retreated and advanced and retreated in no particular order; and whose marked features,
if ever had been set /[(weren't /[(|nearly worth)] individual inspection. If one couldn't look unto the shore with the same awe, as /[(|he or she)] with the same bewilderment and appreciation as
one looked at the sky, they were lost /[(. A| - and they shouldn't have convinced themselves otherwise. In the seas that had their boundaries, and their quite possibly their overlapping segments,
there were anchors. Anchors were people that changed you, pulled you in a certain direction/[(|, for whatever reason)], and were considerably /[(heavy | much stronger)] to take up a great portion
of your /[(mind share | attention)] in comparison to the pulling of the others that slowly we went and hovered in their direction. )]  | /[(|to abide by a model of transformations, perhaps)] we'd
never know. A)] )]nyone who weren't an anchor seemed to fade into the background.)] Choosing your anchors were a luxury, the going paradox had it that life's anchor invariably sought you out and
did the pulling all by themselves/[(|, without even your permission)]. The man in the ask casket was a particularly strong anchor, and Anya had been there why? Not being family, nor ever a friend
of the deceased, she was there for a particular reason.  She had come over to were I had sat, /[(|having either /[(|beforehand)] scoped me out from the back, or /[(just | by chance)] she noticed
me on her way to /[(the front | one of the seats in front, | a front row seat)] /[(Anchors were a thought  | where she very politely asked the woman in black  if she would move over /[( | to the
right)])], /[(|then)] taking her seat right by /[(|me)], she pulled me in/[(|, in two directions; as part of my childhood, and now as part of my ongoing rebellion to the grave.  But she had only
/[(tapped | touched | placed a hand on)] my shoulder from the aisle)]. Weird. But the whole concept of anchors were just that: weird, eery, nearly inexplicable/[(. | /[(but  yet where: |, but
where then::)] were the arguments against it? Yes, /[(*it | they)] were lost in /[(|blue)] the sea/[(|s)] among the anchors! /[(*|*|That was all that I found funny.)] | It was a though /[(a bit
| highly)])]  abstracted  from reality, where I might move myself somewhere or I might pull back with just as much force in the opposite direction.)]
The lights flickered in front.

A famous example of a particular tandem repeat is associated with the Fragile X Syndrome
[Eberhart and Warren, 1996]. The condition is characterized at the molecular level by an unusually
/[(large number of occurences of the repeat string CGG | long patterned sequence whereby the 3 base pairs, CGG,
/[(*:|together::)] appear /[(:one after the other|::appear a certain number of times end-to-end)] /[(|uninterupted)])]. 
This being the the result of a series of mistakes whereby the /[(|repeated)] sequence, which should already exist in some form in 
our genetic code, the length of which varying slightly from individual to individual, at one point went through abnormal /[(|unintentional)] extension 
and duplication /[(|*during transcription)]; this /[(*|mishap)] is /[(::|an occurence:)] known as trinucleotide repeat /[(:expansion|::disorder)].
In the normal population we expect to find this sequence /[(:|at a spot with::)] /[( |, /[( | the residues)])] | the

/[the sites of these repetitions are usually labelled /[(|/[(*|by)] the term)] | we call these sites

/[(|/[(to the individual | at the individual level | for an individual)])], /[(:: |:, as is often the case,)] the number

how could these people be so terrible! It really made envisioning a future for all 7 billion of us homosapeans so very 
/[(hard|difficult)]. And believe me, if in counting 26 we could do it ourselves we would. We even doubted our fitness /[(|for a time)],
for any solution it seemed should be a 3rd grade answer.
<<Offer them cookies? Maybe they'd like that...>> I loved the idea, but how /[(do you make a one off batch of: | does one make::)] 7 billion 
cookies /[(, anyway | exactly|/[(*| if /[(:you|::he)] can't even count properly)])]? We asked /[(ourselves|further)] questions like 'would it be easier to amass all the cookies
