- then it hit me, every story I'd ever /[(heard|read)] was exactly the same. You'd think I'd be /[(outraged | angry about this)]
But no, I wasn't bothered /[(| in the slightest)], how could I be? /[(Besides | It was true that)] the devil's in the 
/[(details, and boy that /[(guy| m************r)]'s a drama queen. | bath waters and boy guy got a hellofa rouse whenever 
he took a /[(shit in it | dump in it /[(when you weren't looking | just as you were about to step in )] )].)] 
Starting petty arguments over who last paid for the roll of toilet paper, the merits of 1-ply vs 2-ply, or whether it proper to 
stumble in at seven o'clock in the morning reeking of gin, cocaine, and tobacco, then having the absolute moxy, or whatever in god's name 
provked the Salesman to tell his wife that the night /[(was|had been)] an absolute bore, /[(as | having learnt that)] companionship, 
when paid for /[(|straight up)], made /[(|for)] the most /[(terrible of | *unpleasant)] conversation /[(|sitting down)]. It had been 
certainly quite unlike what had been advertised in the back of the morning paper, he grumbled. All they did was talk, half of them didn't 
even bother to take off their shoes, can you believe that? And did I mention how they made for /[(|the most)] horrible conversation? 
This, of course, wasn't /[(|nearly the worst or:)] the first of Allen's /[(|:most)] dickish behaviour; before, he went off and blew 
their life savings on some stint in Argentina, where it rained all month long, /[(so he|and the man sank into a fit of depression more 
/[(potent | pronounced | poignant)] than usual. He leapt into his wife's arms, and sobbingly::)] confessed to /[(:his wife|::her)] 
on his return that he had <<barely /[(|even)] enjoyed it>>. It was awful. The man was just plain unhappy, all the time. People like 
/[(this|him)] unfortunately do exist. I knew him for /[(a | an unfortunate)] month, /[(and then deleted | an unpleasant 28 days passed 
before I summoned the courage to delete)] him from my Facebook account (I knew him no longer).
  <<Just walk away /[(|from this one)],>> I told myself. 
But I honestly had hope the piss would somehow turn to wine and I'd forget that I drunk it while it was still yellow and sour.
This was what being an optimist was, I reassured myself. So I read and suffered through several pages more of the bloody thing 
before finally putting it down. Why? Because I was a bloody optimist, goddamnit! Wasn't that clear? /[(It's never easy. | It's only very 
often /[(*easy|difficult)]. But /[(:|when::)] those tumultuous times do pass /[(:and:|::they::)] give /[(birth|way)] to brighter avenues and

Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|gawd awful)]

/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader. /[(|Cuz n|N)]o bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their

She maddeningly empurpled the board with permanent ink. In her mind, Gloria believed she could do so at a whim, and
without a trace impunity. Gloria was right; for that it was her board/[(| to cover and do with as she damn pleased)];
and it would be her and her alone who would have to suffer the consequences of having a white board now 
/[(forever|*permantly)] /[(a deep, uncompromising /[(shade | hue)] of)] purple. /[(Much l|L)]ater, after /[(having
thought | thinking)] about it, she concluded that she liked /[(it | the board)] better /[(that way | purple, and 
/[(unwritable | /[(*|*|wholly)] uneditable)], to her, it /[(*was a | had been /[(her greatest /[(|achievement,)]
a/[(n inspired |)] work of art.)])]>>; <] /[(*|*|worthy of every bit of her admiration)]. The girl beside her poked
her below the table and when Gloria looked over, the girl motioned to the schoolmaster at the head of the room.
Primary school hadn't ever treated Gloria too kindly. If it wasn't for the few friends that she had there she would
have surely ran away.
  <<Do you have the answer? Or were you not paying attention Miss Gloria?>>
  <<63?>>
  <</[(And|Well now)] how did you get that, did the lovely Olivia /[(hand|pass)] it to you /[(below|beneath)] the
    tables? I have half a mind to /[(seperate /[(the two of you | you two:)] /[(|:from eachother)] | remove the two
    of you from eachother)].>>
/[(The pace of Gloria's thoughts grew wilder: | Gloria's mind began to race::)], she couldn't stand the /[(::thought|
:idea)] of being away from her best friend. Olvia was the only friend she had in class, in fact she was the bestest
friend Gloria had in the world. She sat up, scanned the the chalkboard and again repeated the correct answer
/[(|this time)] with /[(*her reasoning | the appropriate /[(solution | /[(sequence | overview)] of steps /[(required
to arrive at a |* leading to a)] /[(solution|correct answer)])])]. 
/[(  <<And would you like to come to the board and write /[(it out | this all out for us)]?>> 
  |  <<Lets see you work this one out /[(:|for us::)] on the board /[(:: | :for us)] now shall we?>> )]
  <<Yes Madame Gregory>> she replied, in /[(that | a)] robotic pitch of /[(*reluctance | obedience)].
Madame Gregory made sure to stare the child down as she walked the walk of shame up to the front of the class /[(|in 
order)] to write her solution to the word problem involving none other than apples and oranges. She /[(first drew 
| began by drawing)] nine apples; each as /[(two capital C's, the second written as if read /[(|directly)] from the
mirror image of the first. To further distinguish the apples from the oranges she gave each /[(|of them)] a small
stem. /[(/[(/[(Then u|U)]nderneath /[(each|*one)>>* <] | Then for every)] apple she drew seven oranges | She then 
drew seven oranges under/[(|neath)] each apple)], and said /[(|/[(*|,)] /[(finally |* at last)] )], 
  <<If the boy were to trade all his apples /[(|*in)] for oranges, he'd have 63 oranges.>>
/[(|Gloria looked /[(|back)] at Madame Gregory expecting her to either correct what she had done or allow her to
return to her seat.)] The shoolmaster looked rather horrified. The girl not only knew what she was doing, but had
given a better answer than she had /[(| herself written down in her notes. The notes she had copied /[(rote
|directly)] from the textbook.)] But there was no excuse for the girl to be staring out the window /[(|like that/[(!
|.)])] /[(, s|. S)]o /[(the schoolmaster|she)] took the girl by the hand, led her out of the classroom and told 
/[(her|the little /[(rugrat|girl)])] if she were to be in "her" classroom she would give "her" and the board the
proper attention /[(*|and respect)] that was expected from everyone else/[(; a |. A)]nd that if she didn't, she
would find another class for the girl where there /[(were|would be)] no windows out from which to daydream all day
long. The little girl sniffled and /[(held back /[(*|*|a pool of)] tears | tried not to cry too loudly)].
The schoolmaster was unmoved. She took a very cold and academic approach to emotion and feeling. Instead 
/[(:|of feeling badly::)] she did what she always did when the world urged /[(::her to care | :her to feel /[(badly 
| any /[(bit|amount)] of compassion for anybody but herself)])] /[(and repeated | by repeating)] to herself 
/[(a line | something:)] /[(she had read in a book once | :her mother used to say)] /[(|*when she was young)].
  <<Tout le monde Ã©/[(st|tait)] dans le misere,>>
/[(*|She had lazily adopted the idea for her own, using it as the base for her own unbending personal philosphy.)]
Each time she said it aloud right after making someone cry the idea seemed to /[(cement:|*reinforce::)] itself
/[(:: |:further)], it was fast approaching /[(/[(universal|eternal)] truth/[(|, in her mind)])]. She thought it quite
fitting, /[(*|and was certainly very proud of herself -)] though it would have been /[(nicer | better placed)] if the
girl had spoken French. For more than fitting, it was beautiful; /[(and | what other)] it entirely excused her 
overreacting. In fact, she hadn't overreacted /[(*|at all)], she /[(thought|assured herself)]; the little girl had
baited her into making a fool of herself in front of the class, and ultimately it was the little girl who is in the
wrong. The next morning Gloria smiled at the schoolmaster as she walked in early. It was the type of smile that you 
/[(|just)] knew had to be genuine. Of course, it was. Gloria knew that she had to make peace with the schoolmaster, 
somehow, as the year had just begun - and all hell would break loose if she didn't. And indeed, she thought, the
schoolmaster was right; it was incredably of her disrespectful to doze off in /[(|the middle of)] class, she wouldn't
have liked it done to her. So she took the schoolmaster's advice and /[(threw her empurpled whiteboard in the dumpster 
behind her apartment building | left her empurpled whiteboard at home. /[(|Because, though it were a work of art, 
there wasn't any use for it in a place of learning*[Emp1]*)] )].  The schoolmaster knew this, and it digusted her.

Footenotes:
 [Emp1]
   - I feel I must add here that when Gloria resigned to the idea of leaving her empurpled whiteboard at home 
     (the work of art that it was) because there would be no use for it in a place of learning, Gloria was being 
     optimistic. For the idea that school was a place of learning, and not just some godforsaken daycare centre, was 
     so important to her sense of well being, that she had to admit that /[(this|the former)] idea was valid - and that 
     it justified making sacrifices. Furthermore it held both in general, and in light of her own particular situation. 
     But, that it was valid, meant that it were at least testably true, and that there was at least some hope, that 
     even if things were bad, /[(*things | they)] could always /[(change for the | get)] better. If it weren't the case, 
     by this definition of validity, she would have surely ran away - /[(*|*|taking her empurpled whiteboard /[(|along)] 
     with her)].


Everyday for him consisted of rummaging through /[(|other peoples/[(|')] )] garbage; the places where /[(most | people)] /[(needn't look: | didn't care to)>> /[(and|or)] <] /[:(and|*or)]  keep after. /[(As such, h| H)]e had /[(*|the /[(ledge|*privilege)] of)] near unquestioned /[(autonomy|*authority)], and was always weary when the next man, /[(and | the/[(*y| one they)] called)] the next best thing, came thraashing through /[(:|and::)] boorishly /[(:: |:and)] started ordering him around. Telling him where and where not to dig and make his way through. This pissed him off to no end, and in these cases he would stop /[(what he was doing and | and stand in place to)] let the fool make a mess of it before /[(getting on|he got on)] with his business.

He looked me in the eyes and stated that, 
<<We were circling the great toilet bowl of existence>>
...Personally, I liked the idea/[(, b|if only b|. B)]ecause a toilet could go it's /[(whole|*entire)] 
life after manufacture without being used. Left alone /[(by|*to)] itself/[(|, abandoned)] 
/[(|, if that were possible)], never to be flushed even once. But here we were. 
This presented either of two possibilities...[...] I liked /[(|them)] both.

Still don't give a shit, go a head, try me. Okay, I give a little bit of a shit, I'll admit that, but it's not

Interesting fact: Not all Canadiens are actually Canadi/[(*an|ien)]. Most of them
are/[(|, I'd give you that)]. But still, /[(* can we not /[(agree|admit)] that /[(this is just a bit |* that's /[(just|somehow)] a bit)] misleading? | doesn't /[(it|that)] seem wrong to

We were singing 'Taaaaaake ME out to the BAAAALL gaaaame, taake ME out to just seeeee'

/[(I'd|I've)] never seen the old man /[(wasted|so wasted)], I kept my distance thinking he might come over

A famous example of a particular tandem repeat is associated with the Fragile X Syndrome
[Eberhart and Warren, 1996]. The condition is characterized at the molecular level by an unusually
/[(large number of occurences of the repeat string CGG | long patterned sequence whereby the 3 base pairs, CGG,

This being the the result of a series of mistakes whereby the /[(|repeated)] sequence, which should already exist in some form in 
our genetic code, the length of which varying slightly from individual to individual, at one point went through abnormal /[(|unintentional)] extension
