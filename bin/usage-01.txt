If you haven't noticed most stories are pretty much the same. We're not bothered /[(of course | at all by this)] /[(|because what intrests most of us lie in the details)].
Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|horrible)] time trying to /[(figure|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring 
people into a scene, kick /[(them|people)] out, and have others /[(|just)] pass through /[(|inconspicuously)], etc, without boring the reader.  No bunny likes pedantry [1].
We're not talking about textbooks here. Professors write textbooks, usually. And when they do they can rest easy knowing that their text will sell no matter how bland or poorly written it may be - especially if they list it as mandatory reading in their /[(syllabus|syllabi)].
Not to say all textbooks are rubbish, a few had me hooked and going 'w/[rep] it=1:20 e /[/]' all the way into the "wh/[rep]1:10 e/[/]" hours of the morning - okay thats not totally true. But I remember once taking one with me when I went to the l/[rep] it=1:2 o/[/]...to visit a friend studying engineering...byob, byotb!

[1] I think the only way to go from here is downhill; what with our tilomere-like attention spans, 30 second commercials, misrepresentative sound bites,
a new obsession with a word meant to generalize and muddy for sake of expediency - and for the fact both parties are probably hopped up on caffeine. Caffeine, according to a friend,
, being the word /[(you play begrundgingly | your forced to spell)] in Scrabble when you draw two F's /[(and you really had your heart set on|and can no longer justify holding out for)] the 'OC'.
Let's not forget the memes. With one picture an entire generation gets the idea, therefore a writers gotta have a lot of hustle to compete with that. I don't know how they do it.
I'd be surprised if you couldn't peice together a hundred memes to tell an EPIC story - that'd draw accolades and comparisons to Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn - oh wait I think I saw something like that on Youtube last week.

Just before she left, she told me to leave a glass upside down over the sink, whether I was there or not. I had given myself away. /[(|My ignorance was telling.)] /[(Oh and she laaauugghed,
l|And she laughed L)]ike she always does, at every new immigrant and import to the city where the rodents outnumber the population tenfold, sometimes in just one single apartment, 
/[(under|beneath)] the sink. I was /[(to cover the hole so as to force |to cover the hole so that I'd force)] the moth*********s through the cracks in the 
/([hardwood floors | floorboard)] - which, apparently /[(|as a whole)] is known to be a much /[(greater|more effective)] rate limiting factor. I shuddered. Suddenly, the charm wore off. I began to smell the fish, and didn't like it. But still she tried to convince me, that this was a whole lot better than anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
This was the first time that I'd heard here it, that growl. It was to be my official welcome; she pointed to a spot out the window /[(with emphasis|dramitically)] /[(adding a| with a resounding)] 
flurry of expletives I half understood. I traced an arrow from that bawny finger of hers over the padded cot, and past /[(the toilet of fully exposed plumbing | the toilet with 
it's plumbing fully exposed)] out through a bright and magnificent 12th story window all the way to the peak of Ellis Island. One can/[(\'t help but| only)] dream-up images of a 
people not unlike ourselves, in a time not unlike the present, without asking 'Where Had They Went?'. It was like they had all stood up for an instant and collapsed. /[(And the mudd rippled like water
 |Causing the mudd to ripple like water
 |Sending ripples of concetric circles through the mudd like a drop of rain in the water.)]
I thought perhaps /[(maybe|by chance)] we were built from the same stuff and it followed that we might carry their essence - along with their struggles, their debt, 
their hopes and dreams, and those tiny fragments of ineffable joy /[(scattered|sprinkled)] inbetween the rocks and buoys. What brand of apathy would they smoke and teach their
children, if any. Squarely in the midst of a vivid experience, I tried to find myself amoung the lines of the elderly, the graduates, the swindlers, the mothers tending to coughing 
children and their fathers - but I was interrupted. Her pointed finger lowered to the exposed pipe /[(protruding|coming)] out from the floorboard /[(|,the one resembling the trunk
of an old /[(oak|tree)] chopped waist high, and covered with moss)]. I'd be remiss to mention, the matching green tub right beside it. 
<<Those 'ill do ya. Another glass and cover that with one as large a condom as possible>>, she said crudely.
I had seen it before, no doubt. I wouldn't admit it to myself, or to anyone else /[(had they asked|for that matter)], that it was what had ultimately drew me to the place.
The two objects stood out and belonged together, making this narrow corridor much more than an enclosed space clustered with a standing assortment of 'necessities'. And I'll admit to having 
open-eye hallucinations of /[(a short round-bellied italian dressed in blue overalls and a red cap who|of a sort, featuring a brave and war-worn italian man with a red cap who)] would jump out from the pipe
emphatically and shake himself dry. You couldn't help but like the guy, salt of the earth really. I felt inclined to help him.
/[(I'd have a chat with him, overlooking much of Manhattan, counselling him through his grief, assuring him that he could do a hellofalot better - while pointing out some inconsistencies..
  |Overlooking much of Manahttan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he could do a hellofalot better - while pointing out some inconsistencies.)]
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good 3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my 
friends - who were living in the worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
Oh and I should tell you about the area I lived in!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live 3 floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.
