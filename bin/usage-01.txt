- then it hit me, every story I'd ever /[(heard|read)] was exactly the same. You'd think I'd be outraged
But no, I wasn't bothered, how could I be? Besides the devil's in the details, 
and boy that /[(guy| m************r)]'s a drama queen. /[(I swear to god it|I swear it|It)]'s every little thing 
with /[(this guy|him)], you won't hear the end of it - nor should you if /[(the pages|two pages in a row /[(*|should)] )]
fall anywhere short of inspiring /[(and|or)] insightful. 

In my opinion, there's /[(really no point | little real benefit)] in running up
the score on purpose. Admittedly, I do take great satisfaction in winning big games against less trained
competition - the feeling fades,as it should, the moment I realize I had /[(*just done|just finished having done)] them 
only the most of modest of favours, one that I /[(:|wouldn't::)] myself /[(|:wouldn't)] /[(|have /[(|even)])]:::)]

Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|gawd awful)]
time trying to /[(figure out|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring 
/[(characters|people)] into a scene, kick them out, and have others /[(|just)] pass through 
/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader. /[(|Cuz n|N)]o bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their

We were singing 'Taaaaaake ME out to the BAAAALL gaaaame, taake ME out to just seeeee'
all sloshy and drunk - even the coaches joined in with us this time.
/[(I'd|I've)] never seen the old man /[(wasted|so wasted)], I kept my distance thinking he might come over 
and disown us in front of all these people. /[(For that terrible game|What a terrible game)]. We were long out of the
playoffs and this final /[(match|game|loss) was /[(to end|the end to)] a miserable drudgery.
We were all stuck in this mechanical going about of things and /[(we didn't know why|no one /[(dared|thought)] to ask 'how come?')].
/[(With the season done, t|T)]he coaches could go back to thinking of how best to
replace every last one of us, the players could finally get back to their lives outside 
of the game, and I would never have to see harry Larry's silly mug again. He punched
me in the shoulder and thanked me for the seasons worth of mentorship while I resisted
the urge to clock him /[(in the face|straight to the floor)].
<<Hey sorry champ, I know that/[('s|was)] your good arm/[(| and all)]!>>, he joked
<<So where you heading?>> I asked jovially.
<<Going back to Indiana,>> he replied <<there's some people there that are
comin and you know I can't miss that.>>
<<Very nice, hey did you get a look at Johnny's picture?>>
<<HO HO HO! JOHNNAAAAAYY! What's this I hear about another dirty /[(photo|movie)]?>>
The man was a god - not Larry, Johnny - who had a photographic memory and 
some /[(damn|darn)] fine drawing skills/[(:|, he was by far the most liked on the team /[(|*and for good reason)]::)].
The first bus ride we had together /[(:as a team|:: )]
he practically drew out the entire 89 edition of Harlequim. The boys would
spoil it of course and he would tirelessly get to work on several others.
But he did grow /[(weary|old|tired)] of the routine. We knew it /[(:|when::)] at once /[(:when|:: )] he nearly
threw /[(one of us|the closest man to him)] out the window
/[(|, the poor guy was so distraught he nearly edged himself /[(over:|out::)])]
/[(:out|::over)] onto incoming traffic. He was funny that way/[(, and we:|. We::)] were of 
course privileged if he ever made another one/[(:. S|::, s)]o we tried not to
ruin them too quickly when he did. I thinkfor that reason, we all, at least subconsciously, made sure /[(to|we'd)] let Larry know last.
/[(:|If he ever  marries, his wife /[(wouldn't|shouldn't)] have to see him as /[(much|often)] as I did that summer.::)]

A famous example of a particular tandem repeat is the Fragile X Syndrome
[Eberhart and Warren, 1996]. Having 3 base pairs at it’s core, CGG, the
/[(method:|disease::)] whereby the /[(|repeated)] sequence is lengthened further
/[(|*during transcription)] is /[(called|named)] trinucleotide repeat /[(:expansion|::disorder)]. In
the normal population /[(we|we’d)] expect to find /[(a contiguous sequence of /[(|the nucleotides|the residues)] CCG repeated|CGG repeated)]
/[(|anywhere from|about)><] 6-52 times at a particular site. For the length of the
core sequence /[(|of residues)], /[(|that is)] < 6 /[(|in this case 3)],
/[the sites of their occurrences are usually called|we call the sites /[(of their occurrence|where they’re found|wherever they’re found)])] microsatellites. In
affected populations, even where there /[(isn’t|aren’t)] any sort of phenotypical
expression visible /[(|/[(to the individual | at the individual level | for an individual)])], the number of repeated CGG residues are much greater than /[(in the normal population.|the range found in the normal population)]

Brute force poetry: The idea that if you think and write about something long 
enough, and know how to /[(navigate and manoeuvre:|navigate/manoeuvre::)] through 
/[(:those thoughts|::that thinking and writing)] /[(:::|, ::::)]effectively/[(:::,|:::: )]
you'll bang out something better than you would otherwise, not necessarily
good, but certainly not crap. Writing crap (at least for me) is effortless.


Every now and then /[(through no fault of my own|)] I get into one of these moods, every last one of them had the right to be rotten. This time it's no different.

....
As we made our way through what /[(|had just:|::just::)] minutes ago /[(:officially become my apartment|::had officially become my apartment)],
I was thoroughly briefed to /[(ensure|make /[(certain|sure)])] /[(that during my time there I'd keep within|my time there would not conflict with|my stay would stay within)]
the rules /[(outlined by the official 'body of governance', who took themselves very seriously | outlined in print by a /[('body of governance'|'governing body')], who took themselves quite seriously| by the governance of the building|of the building)]. 
/[(To be honest, if ever I cared to break the rules I figured|I figured if I /[(ever cared to break|would ever)] the rules|Not one for facist dictatorship I swore to myself)]
I'd consult the accompanying documentation /[(to lead my actions in accordance with the law that'd probably see me do years if not more for something /[(as insidious as|like)] indescent exposure whilst painting over /[(these walls, the:|the walls in the)] /[(: :|main) corridor/[(: in|,)] the lobby, and /[(|then the|the)] reception.)].
For this encyclopedia they /[(|had)] paid a local publishing house good money to print it in hard cover, money they took great care to allot in the quarterly budget - the very same /[(budget|one)] that would /[(would be grossly exceeded then ripped /[(in two /[(|peices)]|to peices)] at year's end|inevitably be exceeded)]
because of market forces /[(noone could /[(have /[(|possibly)] seen coming|/[(have possibly forseen|beyond their control)> >and were ultimately, <]:)] too many 
residents wanted in and /[(a number nearly the same left to live elsewhere without /[(even goodbye or a letter|a letter or even a goodbye.)]|nearly the same number wanted out.)]:
But of course I didn't know this then, so I foolishly sought refuge in /[(a state of deep unstructured thinking|/[(deep unstructured thought of my own /[(making|division|devise)].|a standing state of::)] /[(::antipathy|::slumber)>and<])],
/[(|and)] /[(oh and how he walked|how he walked)> <] (/[(as well|as swell)>and<](*) as any other) /[(|could or has ever done)].
Half alert and barely awake, /[(wholly by accident I caught:|somewhere after)] her /[(|stern)] warning /[(|to)] me that 
I /[(<<NEEDN'T ASK FOR THE ANSWER>> WAS /[(ALWAYS|BOUND)] TO /[(|BE)] <<NEVER>> | <<MOST CERTAINLY>> WAS NOT TO <<PAINT THE WALLS>>,)]
/[(:. Then quickly after, | shortly after)] 
/[(I was struck with a sudden worry that the lengthy elevator up (and down) would prove too much. 2 minutes both ways, everyday, sometimes twice, lets say - /[(|Oi Vey -)] | I began to wonder whether I'd be able to stomach the long elevaor up.)].
Just then, a sharp whistle broke through my /[(thinking|thoughts)] /[(/[(of|to)] which I /[(|of course)] took notice -|requesting that I take notice:)] 
/[(|:take:)] /[(|:greater:)] /[(: ::|:notice:::)] of  /[(this|:: |:::this::::)] /[(|::::freckled)] lady (*). 
/[(|The landlady:)]/[(|,)] /[(|:who:)] /[(:looked impatient::|:was)] /[(|::with me)] tapping away /[(|incessantly)])] at the bottom 
of /[(this large|a large|a)] crystal mug /[(that sat alone in the middle of the sink|sitting in the middle of the sink)]. 
<<Did you hear what I just said?>>   
No.
<<Huh? ugh...there's a dishwasher, isn't there?>>
<<Like I said, only take this off when your washing up. There's some spray underneath in case you need.>>
I had no idea what she was talking about of course but, apparently, I had given myself away.
That I wasn't "from here" was /[(|now|evidently)> ><] clear.  Oh, and she laaaaaaaaaauuuuuugggghed! /[(Oh I remember /[(|quite)] /[(vividly|clearly)] how s|S)]
/[(he laughed so queerly l|L)]ike she always does, at every new
immigrant and import to the city where the rodents outnumber the /[(population|populace)] tenfold in every alley 
/[(|,corner, creek, and crevice - that is, nearly ever locale, enclave, and bourough /[(in proximity|within appreciable distance)] /[(|to anything /[(|and everything)] of /[(relevance:|importance|worth::)> >or<] in this city)] was infested!  How they /[(ever managed |continue still)> >and<] to cover up the fact /[(it|, that the infestation)] had become the cities 
third leading cause /[(for|of)] /[(hospitalization|hospitalization and/or death|death)], I don't know.  I met a nurse who claimed they'd often couple /[(it|the statistic)]
with heart disease and lung failure for lack of /[(any specific|a)] nationally recognized category.
I thought she may have been short for conversation/[(|, pulling my leg|, pulling the leg of /[(this|your)] poor foreigner)]. But no, it was true, and need only be evidenced by 
the ambulances and the haunting hollering of the dogs, /[(followed of course|followed /[(|both|quite)><] sharply and abruptly to the /[(octave|key)>and<])] by the hollering of their owners/[(|,|, /[(|/[(a:|a venerable::)] /[(::/[(choral|choir)]|:/[(|or a fugue)])])])] in /[(high|low)] C on what
seemed like every other sunday somewhere in our building. /[(|/[(T|As per your intuition, t|As you'd expect, t|Of course t|And t)]hey didn't play nicely, not together - and /[(success for the uncoordinated was /[(simple|a simple task)] so long as they came in numbers | success for the uncoordinated | for success the uncoordinated need only attain a certain number that much more than the other to make one a bit uneasy about the whole thing.)] not even twice greater than the /[(|numbers on the)] /[(ther|opposing)] side, a million was unthinkable /[(|(and ultimately humbling))].)]
/[(So we|We)] held our breath and covered our ears outside whilst praying for those trampled underfoot - as the worse
was yet to come for them/[(. And|, and)] the fire department was never quite quick enough; once /[(they|they'd)] ran through several more red

What sort of ceilings do we build for ourselves, and our highly plastic /[(hence capable brains?

- which, apparently as a whole is known to be a much greater rate limiting factor. I shuddered.  Suddenly the charm wore off.
I started to smell the fish and didn't like it. But still she tried to convince me that this was a whole lot better than 
anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
/[(This was /[(|*very)] the first time that I'd here it, a thunder |* I was sure in for it. Had I any foresight I would have readied myself for /[(a thunder|*the clap of thunder that was to follow;)] )]
so powerful and full of pride /[(that it would continue to boom and echoe in hollows of my memory for some time after | that sound, like the roar of lion, /[(defending|in defence of)] his pride. /[(To leave one wimpering while their ears rung. | I might have heard myself wimper if my ears weren't /[(weren't to busy ringing|ringing as loudly as they were)].)] )]
/[(It was to be my official welcome; | I couldn't imagine a more informative welcome to the city - I stood alert and at attention as)] she pointed to a spot out the window /[(with emphasis|dramitically)], /[(adding a| with a resounding)] 
flurry of expletives I half understood. /[(|And so)] I traced an arrow from /[(her lanky finger|that lanky finger of hers)] over the padded

out through this bright and /[(brilliant | magnificent |brilliantly /[(*illuminated|magnificent)])] 12th story /[(|apartment)] window all the way to the peak of 
Ellis Island. I immediately understood/[(. O|, /[(because|*and)] o)]ne can't help but dream-up images of a people not unlike ourselves, in a time
not unlike the present, without asking 'Where Had They Went?'. It was like they had all stood up for an 
instant and collapsed. And the mudd rippled like water. 
/[(|Sending ripples of concetric circles through the mudd like a drop of rain in a still body of water.)]
I thought perhaps /[(just maybe|by chance)>>,<,] we were built from the same stuff and /[(|that)] it followed /[(that|)] we

inbetween the rocks and buoys. Just what brand of apathy would they smoke and teach their children
/[(|, if any)]? Or were they all just happy, and content /[(to journey a new beginning? | at the thought of a new beginning?)]
Squarely in the midst of a vivid experience, I tried /[(:|as best as I could)] /[(:finding|*to find)] myself amoungst the

interrupted /[(|*once more [(*| - again)]|once again)> - <]. Her pointed finger lowered to the exposed pipe /[(protruding|coming)] out
from the floorboard; the one resembling the trunk of an old /[(oak|tree)] chopped waist high/[(|,)] and covered with moss. (Dec 30. 2012, lol)
I'd be remiss, also, not to mention the matching green tub /[(right beside it | to left of it | just to the right of it)]. 
<<Those 'ill do ya. Another glass and cover that one with as large a condom as /[(possible /[(|if you can find it)]|you can find)]>>, she said crudely.
I had seen /[(the pair | them)] before, no doubt. And I wouldn't admit it to myself, or to 
anyone else /[(|had they asked|for that matter)], /[(that /[(*this tub and toilet|the tub and toilet|this pair - the tub and toilet -)]  /[(/[(|* the two of them /[(they|had)])] delighted me to no end|had /[(|really)] sold it for me|were all I liked|brought me joy /[(unlike any other|like no other)])]|they were /[(indeed the only reason why I liked the place.|quite frankly all that I liked about the place)])].
/[(:|Surely no /[(two|other two|two other)] peices of porceleain would dare admit to such uniqueness, but these /[(did|two peices /[(did| they pulled it off /[(- and /[(in bearing all /[(|/[(were|proved)] shameless)] - I was starry eyed and weepy /[(|I tell you)], the guys back home would either give me a good slog or join with all it's mysticism and allusory reference |* whilst bearing all they were shameless)])])])].)]
/[(:Other peices of porcelain /[(wouldn't admit to such uniqueness.|didn't admit as much uniqueness /[(as these)])].  I knew /[(nothing|hardly anything)] of their origins/[(|, not really,)] but there could be no sane argument against the /[(|truth that)]/[(,|.)] /[(/[(t|Quite simply t)]hese two objects|the two)] stood out and belonged together, inseperably /[(bound each-to-the-other|bound|tied together)] by a plumbing /[(|both)]seen and /[(out of sight|unseen)>and<],)]
/[(which made |making|and made|and I must say it made)] this narrow /[(|little)] corridor /[(|so)] much more than an enclosed space 
/[(littered|sparsley littered)] with the usual standing /[(sort|assortment)] of 
/[(|common,)]/[(modern, everday|modern-day)] 'necessities'. I felt at home - and /[(they'd call:|they called::)] out to me/[(:. T|:: t)]ime and time again.
About as strongly as I imagine the earth does from /[(this:::|that::::)] /[(/[(:::distance /[(|above)]|::::elevation)] where paradoxically I/[('d been|was)] thouroughly grounded)]. And as I stared straight down into 
the abyss I'll admit I had visions of a sort: open-eye hallucinations of a short round-bellied italian /[(|man)]
dressed in blue overalls who'd /[(spring up|leap|jump)] out from /[(|the mouth of)] this green pillar [...] and shake himself dry.
The culmination of some grand and labourious effort, I'm sure. What ever it was, he was damp, spent, and wanted nothing more /[(but|than)] to collapse /[(on|to)] /[(|the floor)].
Of course I hadn't the stomach to be of much help, him reeking of /[(|our)] putrid waste and sewege /[(|all)] layed out 
on the floor like that. But I'd do what I could the minute he regained consciousness. /[(So as it goes, o|And so o)]verlooking 
much of Manhattan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he could certainly do a hellofalot better -  
/[(*in the hope|with the hope)] that these few /[(|words of)] encouragement plus the dim reality of
/[(just how far /[(this browser|his browser)] had /[(taken him|led him)] | where his travels had led him,)]
would perhaps spark in him some sort of all-encompassing epiphany; a truth /[(|/[(that would|with which to)] orient /[(him|his person|M n his person|him and his person)] in space and time| recovering his previous orientation in space and time - for I knew too well he /[(couldn't|does not|didn't)] /[(exist|be)] here)], /[(|then perhaps he'd share /[(|with us)] his content. | /[(|the content of which|and one whose content of which)] /[(|just maybe)] perhaps he'd /[(/[(|be so gracious)] share|mention, to free my mind of /[(|all)] /[(|it's)] /[(|worry and)] prention/[(|s)], /[(because I was way too familiar|for I was all too familiar)] with what he was going through - and this life didn't permit one to ask such /[(|probing)] questions or allow us the time to seek the answer any way but superficially - and I needn't /[(have|let)] anyone else /[(|speak for me and)] be my witness that /[(there|in there|only /[(after having|in the moment I)] lent /[(my good eye|myself)] to a terrible aspect)] had I found the truth /[(to be severely punishing|, and was /[(/[(|severely)] punished for it | instantly reprimanded for having succeeded)]))]. A content that seemed to have so much importance yet was /[(|beyond my experience)] entirely imagined at best.
As others have said, 'What is life if /[(/[(should it|were it)] be)]/[(|left)] unexamined?'.
And surely an idea is just a sophisticated delusion /[(masaged gently, some more than others, before being
unleashed unto the world in physical form without dislaimer and or warrantee - and yes there is no consumer
protection, that would be wrong. For every drunkard to do a plank off the side of a building, consider it natural selection. It's only in the interest of a few that the game's currency is /[(|is two be)] set in /[(|large /[(stroke and [(brush /[*(|to make form of)] |brushes)]|brush strokes of)])] grandiose delusion /[(|that is,)] until we find something better /[(|to write atop the space of whatevers already there there; annotating the chaffe /[(|from the waste and there)] from the rest, burning a black canvas bright blue or whatever color we like -)]
making one new year/[(|s)](*[4]) resolution to "devote more time and energy to greater /[(thought and integrity|integrity of thought)]" come true, and use space left over to imagine and nurture delusions of /[(lofty|loftier)] ideals /[(in|with)] solace of mind and /[(|with)] a/[(|dash of|bit of)] daring infallibility.
The thought of the grinding heard was unbearable, but it wasn't my imagination.
Anyway,
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good
3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my friends - who were living in the 
worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
I /[(took|take)] no pleasure in this /[(|fact)].
Oh /[(and|but)] I should tell you about the area/[(| I live in)]!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live /[(3|4)] floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.



So /[(I guess|it looks like)] I've taken to potty humor. The sort that sees childhood heroes spring
from toilets /[(|as thought it were usual)]  - no wonder /[(I've:|I'd::)] never /[(/[(: :::|:: ::::|been able to:::::)] /[('|'just)] /[(:::::get|:::got|::::get)] on with it already', so easily without hesitation (lol) | liked them | got on with those things)].
The story, though nasty, is no more disgusting than the shit I hear about these /[(|rat infested*)] streets.
Things I can't imagine,
The kind to make me sick of this city.
I didn't start this war, and as expected it's me who's quivering in some dark corner hoping /[(I /[(wouldn't|shouldn't)] be found; | they wouldn't find me;)] 
hoping that the other 26 of us, all thats left of /[(genuine niceity|true kindness|indiscriminant good will)> >and<], 
don't lose their heads in the midst of /[(|all)] this frenzy -- if they ever got caught...
how could these people be so terrible! It really made envisioning a future for all 7 billion of us homosapeans so very 
hard. And believe me, if in counting 26 we could do it ourselves we would. We even doubted our fitness /[(|for a time)],
for any solution it seemed should be a 3rd grade answer.
<<Offer them cookies? Maybe they'd like that...>> I loved the idea, but how /[(do you make a one off batch of | does one make)] 7 billion 
cookies /[(|exactly)]? We asked /[(ourselves|further)] questions like 'would it be easier to amass all the cookies 
currently in circulation and send that number in their original packaging to mars /[(more easily than it would be to feed a certain 7billion of us each at least one cookie in 5 years with no mention of effiency)], /[(*or|no)] fiscal constraints.>>
<<But what about the rainforest?>> 
<<We should seek to protect it.>>
And /[(|even if this "were" possible)] should we really think to give them out /[(|each)] one at time? Ideally, a cookie should fall from the sky
- everywhere - /[(|to cover /[(every|the)] inhabited region /[(|*entirely)])] and at least least half should be eaten;
prompting people to believe in miracles /[(again|once again)], and /[(|we'll)] live happily ever after very fat and pimplish, 
and that'll be what's in, so noone will care and you wont be different, for F-and-P would be /(simply be irresistable|just as hot as it was before.)><] 
F-and-P hadn't /[(risen|rose)] to it's current prominence nor was there anything greater than being pimpled and carryable only
only by crane. /[(/[(Every other /[(state|option)>* and <] | Everything else)] being the same. | All else equal.)] Just as it was
right before we decided to overthrow the kings, and their noble courts. And this would be fact, 
/[(and not just a bit of nonsense|and not)] to be argued /[(|with /[(*|and refuted)] )]. /[(Furthermore|And)] noone would ever
say a single retarded thing about anything, because they vetted their utterence and their writing(?) so that it shouldn't 
pollute the air /[(anymore than it /[(|already)] was|any further)]. It was like driving less,
recycling more, and putting /[(that|our|*your)] goddamn trash where it belongs in the garbage so we /[(|shouldn't | don't)]
/[(*see|happen upon)] another outbreak of the plague. Or something like that/[(*.|, in our minds)].
