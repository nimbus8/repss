But no, I wasn't bothered, how could I be? Besides the devil's in the details, /[(*|certainly)]

/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader. /[(|Cuz n|N)]o bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their

We were singing 'Taaaaaake ME out to the BAAAALL gaaaame, taake ME out to just seeeee'
all sloshy and drunk - even the coaches joined in with us this time.
/[(I'd|I've)] never seen the old man /[(wasted|so wasted)], I kept my distance thinking he might come over 
and disown us in front of all these people. /[(For that terrible game|What a terrible game)]. We were long out of the
playoffs and this final /[(match|game|loss) was /[(to end|the end to)] a miserable drudgery.
We were all stuck in this mechanical going about of things and /[(we didn't know why|no one /[(dared|thought)] to ask 'how come?')].
/[(With the season done, t|T)]he coaches could go back to thinking of /[(*|just)] how best to
replace every last one of us, the players could finally get back to their lives outside 
of the game, and I would never have to see harry Larry's silly mug again. He punched
me in the shoulder and thanked me for the seasons worth of mentorship while I resisted
the urge to clock him /[(in the face|straight to the floor)].
<<Hey sorry champ, I know that/[('s|was)] your good arm/[(| and all)]!>>, he joked
<<So where you heading?>> I asked jovially.
<<Going back to Indiana,>> he replied <<there's some people there that are
comin and you know I can't miss that.>>
<<Very nice, hey did you get a look at Johnny's picture?>>
<<HO HO HO! JOHNNAAAAAYY! What's this I hear about another dirty /[(photo|movie)]?>>
The man was a god - not Larry, Johnny - who had a photographic memory and 
some /[(damn|darn)] fine drawing skills/[(:|, he was by far the most liked on the team /[(|*and for good reason)]::)].
The first bus ride we had together /[(:as a team|:: )]
he practically drew out the entire 89 edition of Harlequim. The boys would
spoil it of course and he would tirelessly get to work on several others.
But he did grow /[(tired|weary|old)>>and<] of the routine. We knew it /[(:|when::)] at once /[(:when|:: )] he nearly

Every now and then /[(through no fault of my own|)] I get into one of these moods, every last one of them had the right to be rotten. This time it's no different.

....
As we made our way through what /[(|had just:|::just::)] minutes ago /[(:officially become my apartment|::had officially become my apartment)],
I was thoroughly briefed to /[(ensure|make /[(certain|sure)])] /[(that during my time there I'd keep within|my time there would not conflict with|my stay would stay within)]
the rules /[(outlined by the official 'body of governance', who took themselves very seriously | outlined in print by a /[('body of governance'|'governing body')], who took themselves quite seriously| by the governance of the building|of the building)]. 
/[(To be honest, if ever I cared to break the rules I figured|I figured if I /[(ever cared to break|would ever)] the rules|Not one for facist dictatorship I swore to myself)]

For this encyclopedia they /[(|had)] paid a local publishing house good money to print it in hard cover, money they took great care to allot in the quarterly budget - the very same /[(budget|one)] that would /[(be grossly exceeded then ripped /[(in two /[(|peices)]|to peices)]/[(*|,)] /[(*|*|something like)] every second sunday | inevitably be exceeded)>>*, <]

/[(*I was never really good at this...|:. Then quickly after, | shortly after)]

I had no idea what she was talking about of course but, apparently, I had given myself away.

I thought she may have been short for conversation/[(|, pulling my leg|, pulling the leg of /[(this|your)] poor foreigner)]. But no, it was true, and need only be evidenced by 
the ambulances and the haunting hollering of the dogs, /[(followed of course|followed /[(|both|quite)><] sharply and abruptly to the /[(octave|key)>and<])] by the hollering of their owners/[(|,|, /[(|/[(a:|a venerable::)] /[(::/[(choral|choir)]|:/[(|or a fugue)])])])] in /[(high|low)] C on what

- which, apparently as a whole is known to be a much greater rate limiting factor. I shuddered.  Suddenly the charm wore off.
I started to smell the fish and didn't like it. But still she tried to convince me that this was a whole lot better than 
anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
/[(This was /[(|*very)] the first time that I'd here it, a thunder |* I was sure in for it. Had I any foresight I would have readied myself/[(|*, and my ears in particular,)] for /[(a thunder|*the clap of thunder that was to follow;)] )]

The culmination of some grand and labourious effort, I'm sure. What ever it was, he was damp, spent, and wanted nothing more /[(but|than)>>other<] to collapse /[(on|to)] /[(|the floor)], his head struck the wood panelling with a thud as he fell face forward /[(|/[(:|having had his arms::)] fail/[(:ing|:: )] to break his fall)].
Of course I hadn't the stomach to be of much help to the /[(|man)], him reeking of /[(|our|societies)] putrid waste and sewege /[(|all)] /[(layed|stretched)] out 
on the floor like that. But I'd do what I could the minute he regained consciousness. /[(So as it goes, o|And so o)]verlooking 
much of Manhattan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he could certainly do a hellofalot better -  
/[(*in the hope/[(*|s)] |with the hope)] that these few /[(|words of)] encouragement plus the dim reality of
/[(just how far /[(this browser|his browser)] had /[(taken him|led him)] | where his travels had led him,)]
would perhaps spark in him some sort of all-encompassing epiphany; a truth /[(|/[(that would|with which to)] orient /[(him|his person|M n his person|him and his person)] in space and time| recovering his previous orientation in space and time - for I knew too well he /[(couldn't|does not|didn't)] /[(exist|be)] here)], /[(| /[(|the content of which|and one whose content of which)] /[(|just maybe)] perhaps he'd /[(|be so gracious to)] /[(share | mention, to free my mind of /[(|all)] /[(|it's)] /[(|worry and)] prention/[(|s)], /[( /[(me being | /[(because|for)] I was)] /[(way|all)] too familiar)] with what he was going through - and this life didn't normally permit one to ask such /[(|probing)] questions or allow us the time to seek the answer any way but superficially - and I needn't /[(have|let)] anyone else /[(|speak for me and)] be my witness that /[(there|in there|only /[(after having|in the moment I)] lent /[(my good eye|myself)] to a terrible aspect)] had I found the truth /[(to be severely punishing.

What else was there to do? And by who /[(were it|might it have been)] put there?.
As others have said, 'What is life if /[(/[(should it|were it)] be)]/[(|left)] unexamined?'.
And surely an idea is just a sophisticated delusion /[(masaged gently, some more than others, before being
unleashed unto the world in physical form without dislaimer and or warrantee - and yes there is no consumer
protection, that would be wrong. For every drunkard to do a plank off the side of a building, consider it natural selection. It's only in the interest of a few that the game's currency is /[(|is two be)] set in /[(|large /[(stroke and [(brush /[*(|to make form of)] |brushes)]|brush strokes of)])] grandiose delusion /[(|that is,)] until we find something better /[(|to write atop the space of whatevers already there there; annotating the chaffe /[(|from the waste and there)] from the rest, burning a black canvas bright blue or whatever color /[(have you | we like)] -)]

Who knows? /[(|/[(You::|We:) might just make something out of this/[(:.|::as might I soon as I return to my proper place of resting)] )].
The thought of the grinding heard was unbearable, but /[(|/[(this|for the first)] time)] it wasn't my imagination - it was clear /[(|as anything)] they were coming to get me.
Anyway,
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good
3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my friends - who were living in the 
worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
I /[(took|take)] no pleasure in this /[(|fact)].
Oh /[(and|but)] I should tell you about the area/[(| I live in)]!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live /[(3|4)] floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.



So /[(I guess|it looks like)] I've taken to potty humor. The sort that sees childhood heroes spring
from toilets /[(|as thought it were usual)]  - no wonder /[(I've:|I'd::)] never /[(/[(: :::|:: ::::|been able to:::::)] /[('|'just)] /[(:::::get|:::got|::::get)] on with it already', so easily without hesitation (lol) | liked them | got on with those things)].
The story, though nasty, is no more disgusting than the shit I hear about these /[(|rat infested*)] streets.
Things I can't imagine,
The kind to make me sick of this city.
I didn't start this war, and as expected it's me who's quivering in some dark corner hoping /[(I /[(wouldn't|shouldn't)] be found; | they wouldn't find me;)] 
hoping that the other 26 of us, all thats left of /[(genuine niceity|true kindness|indiscriminant good will)> >and<], 
don't lose their heads in the midst of /[(|all)] this frenzy -- if they ever got caught...
how could these people be so terrible! It really made envisioning a future for all 7 billion of us homosapeans so very 
/[(hard|difficult)]. And believe me, if in counting 26 we could do it ourselves we would. We even doubted our fitness /[(|for a time)],
for any solution it seemed should be a 3rd grade answer.
<<Offer them cookies? Maybe they'd like that...>> I loved the idea, but how /[(do you make a one off batch of | does one make)] 7 billion 
cookies /[(|exactly|/[(*| if you couldn't count properly)])]? We asked /[(ourselves|further)] questions like 'would it be easier to amass all the cookies 
currently in circulation and send that number in their original packaging to mars /[(more easily than it would be to feed a certain 7billion of us each at least one cookie in 5 years with no mention of effiency /[(/[(while /[(|still)] being|and still be)] fiscally responsible | /[(/[(and|no)]|or)] fiscal constraints. )] )]/[(.|?)]>>
<<But what about the rainforest?>> 
<<We should seek to protect it.>>
And /[(|even if this "were" possible)] should we really think to give them out /[(|each)] one at time? Ideally, a cookie should fall from the sky
- everywhere - /[(|to cover /[(every|the)] inhabited region /[(|*entirely)])] and at least least half should be eaten;
prompting people to believe in miracles /[(again|once again)], and /[(|we'll)] live happily ever after very fat and pimplish, 
and that'll be what's in, so noone will care and you wont be different, for F-and-P would /[( be /[( /[(*|quite)] simply | simply be... )] irresistable (something like splenda) | just as hot as it was before.)><] 
F-and-P wouldn't have /[(risen|rose)] to /[(the: | it's)] /[(current|stated|: the :)] prominence /[(:I /[(/[(stated|referred to)] /[(but a sentance or three prior to /[(*|to the reader)] )] )] )], nor was there anything greater than being pimpled and carryable only
only by crane /[(|and /[(*|industrial)] forklift )]. /[(/[(Every other /[(state|option)>* and <] | Everything else)] being the same. | All else equal.)] Just as it was
right before we decided to overthrow the kings, and their noble courts. And this would be fact, 
/[(and not just a bit of nonsense|and not)] to be argued /[(|with /[(*|and refuted)] )]. /[(Furthermore|And)] noone would ever
say a single retarded thing about anything, because they vetted their utterence and their writing(?) so that it shouldn't 
pollute the air /[(anymore than it /[(|already)] was|any further)]. It was like driving less,
recycling more, and putting /[(that|our|*your)] goddamn trash where it belongs in the garbage so we /[(|shouldn't | don't)]
/[(*see|happen upon)] another outbreak of the plague. Or something like that/[(*.|, in our minds)].
