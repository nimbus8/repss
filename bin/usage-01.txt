- then it hit me, every story I'd ever /[(heard|read)] was exactly the same. You'd think I'd be outraged
But no, I wasn't bothered, how could I be? Besides the devil's in the details, 
and boy that /[(guy| m************r)]'s a drama queen. /[(I swear it|It)]'s every little thing 
with /[(him|this guy)], you won't hear the end of it - nor should you if the pages fall 
anywhere short of inspiring /[(and|or)] insightful. How many books have you put down? Maybe not enough.



Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|gawd awful)]
time trying to /[(figure out|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring 
people into a scene, kick them out, and have others /[(|just)] pass through 
/[(|inconspicuously)] without boring the reader.  No bunny likes pedantry [1]. Not while their 
"hopped" up on caffeine, no. Silly bunnies, when caught once with caffeine they claimed dislexia
- and got off.


....
As she casually led me from one end to the other, I remember I had nearly dozed off.
Somewhere after her warning I WEREN'T TO PAINT THE WALLS, 
/[(a sudden worry that the lengthy elevator up (and down) would prove too much. 2 minutes both ways, everyday, sometimes twice, lets say - | I began to wonder whether I'd be able to stomach the long elevaor up.)].
She was tapping at the bottom of this crystal mug sitting in the middle of the sink. 
<<Did you hear what I just said?>>   
No.
<<Huh? Sorry, ugh there's a dishwasher, yes?>>
<<Like I said, only take this off when your washing up. There's some spray underneath in case you need.>>
I had given myself away, of course.  Oh and she laaauugghed! Like she always does, at every new
immigrant and import to the city where the rodents outnumber the population tenfold in every alley and 
undiscovered crevice. How they  managed to cover up the fact /[(it|, that the infestation)] had become the cities 
third leading cause of /[(hospitalization|death)], I don't know.  I met a nurse who claimed they'd often couple 
it with heart disease and lung failure for lack of /[(any specific|a)] nationally recognized category. 
I thought she may have been short for conversation. But no, it was true, and need only be evidenced by 
the ambulances and the haunting hollering of the dogs, followed of course by the hollering of their owners, on what
seemed like every other second tuesday somewhere in our building.
We held our breath and covered our ears outside whilst praying for those trampled underfoot - as the worse
was yet to come for them. And the fire department was never quite quick enough; Once they ran through several more red 
lights than usual, taking dozens of folks underneath them in response. The mayor called it the most courageous /[(act|gesture)] he'd ever 
witnessed - For the many more live's they'd saved. I'd tend to agree. Such was the sad irony of this oft occuring madness. 
/[(And Once|Once)] you'd seen one of these Infestivals, the Conventional Wisdom was etched into the mind forever: 
'Just Cover The /[(|Bloody)] Hole And Force The Moth*********'s Through The Cracks In The /[(Floorboard | Hardwood floors)]' 
- which, apparently as a whole is known to be a much greater rate limiting factor. I shuddered.  Suddenly the charm wore off. I started to smell 
the fish and didn't like it. But still she tried convince me that this was a whole lot better than 
anywhere else.
<<What made this /[(dirty|decrepit)] little corner so much better than /[(the next | anywhere else)]?>>, I asked.
This was the first time that I'd here it, so powerful and full of pride like the roar of lion. 
It was to be my official welcome; she pointed to a spot out the window /[(with emphasis|dramitically)] /[(adding a| with a resounding)] 
flurry of expletives I half understood. I traced an arrow from that lanky finger of hers over the padded
cot, and past /[(the toilet of fully exposed plumbing | the toilet with it's plumbing fully exposed)] 
out through this bright and /[(brilliant | magnificent)] 12th story window all the way to the peak of 
Ellis Island. One can/[(\'t help but| only)] dream-up images of a people not unlike ourselves, in a time
not unlike the present, without asking 'Where Had They Went?'. It was like they had all stood up for an 
instant and collapsed.
/[(And the mudd rippled like water. | Sending ripples of concetric circles through the mudd like a drop of rain in a lake.)]
I thought perhaps /[(just maybe|by chance)] we were built from the same stuff and it followed that we
might carry /[(|with us)] their essence - along with their struggles, their debt, their hopes and dreams, and 
those tiny fragments of ineffable joy /[(scattered|sprinkled)] inbetween the rocks and buoys. 
What brand of apathy would they smoke and teach their children if any? Squarely in the midst of a vivid 
experience, I tried /[(finding|to find)] myself amoungst the lines of the elderly, the graduates, the 
swindlers, the mothers tending to coughing children and their fathers - but I was interrupted. Her 
pointed finger lowered to the exposed pipe /[(protruding|coming)] out from the floorboard 
; the one resembling the trunk of an old /[(oak|tree)] chopped waist high, and covered with moss. 
I'd be remiss, also, not to mention the matching green tub /[(right beside it | to left of it | just to the right of it)]. 
<<Those 'ill do ya. Another glass and cover that one with as large a condom as /[(possible|you can find)]>>, she said crudely.
I had seen /[(the two | the pair | them)] before, no doubt. I wouldn't admit it to myself, or to 
anyone else /[(had they asked|for that matter)], that they were indeed the only reason why I liked the place.
These two objects stood out and belonged together, inseperably tied together by a plumbing seen and 
/[(out of sight|unseen)], /[(which made | making|and made)] this narrow corridor much more than an enclosed space 
/[(clustered|littered|sparsley littered)] with the usual standing assortment of 
/[(|common)] modern-day 'necessities', into a place I could call home. They called out to me, about as strongly as I imagine the earth does from
this elevation. /[(In confidence, I admit I had visions of a sort; | And I'll admit /[(to having|I had)] )]
open-eye hallucinations of a short round-bellied italian /[(|man)] dressed in blue overalls who'd
/[(spring up|leap|jump)] out from the mouth of this green pillar with /[(|much)] vigour /[(and|then)] shake himself dry.
He'd /[(soil|dirty)] my curtains /[(|every time)], but you couldn't stay angry at the guy - salt of the earth really. 
I felt inclined to help him. Overlooking much of Manhattan, I would counsel him through this grief; assuring M that he 
could certainly do a hellofalot better -  hoping that these encouragements and the reality of where his travels had led him,
would spark in him some sortt of all-encompassing epiphany, and that perhaps he'd share, for I too had
become the worse for wear.
I still don't know why I rented the place when I did, I didn't sleep - much less live - there for a good
3 months until I'd made certain that I was indeed the envy of all my friends - who were living in the 
worst of conditions and for a price that would exhaust a shieks fortune (in little under a year). 
Oh and I should tell you about the area I live in!
Georgious. Lenny from down the hall said a famous singer might live /[(3|4)] floors up. I wouldn't doubt it.
