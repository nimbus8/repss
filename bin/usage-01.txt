If you haven't noticed most stories are pretty much the same. We're not bothered /[(of course | at all by this)] /[(|because what intrests most of us lie in the details)].  Though I imagine the man or woman who makes their living writing fiction must have a /[(terrible|horrible)] time trying to /[(figure|flesh out)] simple things like how to bring people into a scene, kick /[(them|people)] out, and have others just pass through, etc, without boring the reader.
We're not talking about textbooks here. Professors write textbooks, usually. And when they do they can rest easy knowing that their text will sell no matter how bland or poorly written it may be - especially if they list it as mandatory reading in their /[(syllabus|syllabi)].
Not to say all textbooks are rubbish, a few had me hooked and going 'w/[rep] it=1:20 e /[/]' all the way into the "wh/[rep]1:10 e/[/]" hours of the morning - okay thats not totally true. But I remember once taking one with me when I went to the l/[rep] it=1:2 o/[/]...to visit a friend studying engineering...byob, byotb!
