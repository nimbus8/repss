Cockroaches!
------------
I assure you not nearly a week has passed.
Not since men in cardigans sat about a fire consuming roaches.
The fire itself was unremarkable. All that felt it's warmth thought it unremarkable.
Fire to them merely a tool necessary to their occupations; to be jettisoned, lampooned, and left on it's own -
to simmer - ensuring no seed cwould ever prosper in it's wake etcetera etc. 
A means to a ruinous end essentially. Therein that moment, its purpose was as equally self-serving. 
The flames danced in and about the dark pits of their eyes (the pupils) as the men devoured roach after roach
one at a time, (like) a true group of dining philosophers - a joke often repeated. 
That night roaches were on the menu, and these roaches, I tell you, were no ordinary roaches.
Few roaches can be considered ordinary to begin, but we recognize these roaches by the attention that they command
- the delicacy with which they're handled. For many there exists no greater horror...for these men that horror was ecstacy. 
I nor they themselves can explain just %why% exactly, one gets that deep feeling of revulsion
- an involuntary reflex if you will - that causes [the] blood to flee the part of the brain that gives us calm, -
that small peice of mind. Encoded (indel)lably in our biology, no doubt.  
/[rep] a=0:8 f ye fo fum fout /[/]
It's worth noting the extent to which these cardigan clad men came and went in pursuit of the so called "rarified breeds" 
- it bordered on insanity. That same vigor with which we are all familiar, interestingly enough, -
has (actually) tempered relations between neighbouring states and provinces the world over.
/[rep] a=10:1 
second half /[/]
Those who cared - the *artisans*, the *connaisseurs*, *the politicians* - were never so interested in their local varieties.
The stench of familiarity so great, even amoungst the most enthused, that governments and private contractors -
chartered steamboats, military jets, and lunar space shuttles to be packed to the tilt. 
The roaches were transported from the far reaches of the congo to the dirty underground basements 
%where the cardigan clad men would congregate%, often sporting beaded masks in a lazy attempt to hide their %identities% [1]. 
Needless to say the %boatsmen%, the %pilots%, and the %astronauts% were never in such precarious situations 
- every man/woman/andindivudual received a gold brick for every roach they kept their hands off of.
All went home poorer than they left. But you know in this world there are much more important things...

The Thankless Majician
----------------------
There are three parts to this thing that must be in order
the first being the entry,
the majician enters the stage and presents as ordinary an entity as any
be it a bird, a box, or a man,
whatever the case, a good magician will always ask you to inspect it, 
bringing you up on stage encouraging you to touch and feel this thing to confirm that it is indeed of the ordinary
- when of course, it isn't
It never is
You shouldn't trust a majician,
that box with six sides has twelve
and this is no issue of semantics,
or of dimension,
you simply had to be there at the moment of construction,
to fully appreciate the dull precipace that'll fool the second most intelligent man in the room
And there it is, he thought - but He wouldn't clap yet
No, because making something dissappear is not so impressive
what do you think happens when we blink our eyes
and if something that were there an instant before should dissappear the next,
it may may well as never been there or ever existed
the same applies here,
call it a collective amnesia if you will,
no matter, the point is noone appreciates that
instead you have to hold it there - whatever it is - for as long as possible and make it's presence be known
it needn't delight them or annoy them, just get their attention
then take it away for effect; for a time, forcing Him to contemplate it's absence
and here's where the majician must understand comedic timing, 
just before they forget and especially before He stops caring
then there the majician must carryout his grand reveal as part of the final act
but it's hard being a majician; somehow noones ever surprised, and few will ever clap at the end

Oh boy. I need to get a life, /[(o|b|v|i|o|u|s|l|y)].
