lowly rolly polly olly. %sample.cpp% I assure you not nearly a week has passed. Not since men in cardigans sat about a fire consuming/enjoying roaches. The fire itself was unremarkable. All that felt it's warmth, thought it unremarkable. Fire to them merely a tool necessary to their occupations; to be jetesonned, lampooned, left on it's own to simmer - ensuring no seed could ever prosper in it's wake etcera etcera. A means to a ruinous end. There at that moment, its purpose was equally self-serving. The flames danced in and about the dark pits of their eyes as the men devoured roach after roach one at a time, like (a true group of) dining philosophers - a joke repeated often. These roaches, you see, were no ordinary roaches. Few roaches can be considered ordinary to begin with, but we recognize these roaches by the attention that they command - the delicacy with which they are handled. For many there exists no greater horror... They can't examplain %why% exactly, it's a just one of those deep feelings of revulsion - an involuntary reflex if you will. The result of persuasive conditioning.  It's worth noting the extent to which these cardigan clad men came and went in pursuit of so called "rarified breeds" - it bordered on insanity. That same vigor with which we are all familiar, interestingly enough, has actually tempered relations between neighbouring states and provinces the world over.

Those who cared - the *artisans*, the *connaisseurs*, *the politicians* - were never so interested in their local varieties. The stench of familiarity so great, even amoung the most enthused, that governments and private contractors chartered steamboats, military jets, and lunar space shuttles to be packed to the tilt. The roaches were transported from the far reaches of the congo to the dirty underground basements %where the cardigan clad men would congregate%, often sporting beaded masks in a lazy attempt to hide their %identities% [1]. Needless to say the %boatsmen%, %pilots%, and %astronauts% were never in such precarious situations - every man received a gold brick for each roach they kept their hands off of. All went home poor, but you in know in this world there are much more important things.

In Belgium every second sunday is rarely referred to as "nuit de pieds nu". (one might hear colloquialisms of the same humour spoken elsewhere)
