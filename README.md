This project is written in "C++11", for no particular reason.

What is repss?
  Repss is in part designed to be a scaffolding on top of written language.  The designer of the language is astonished
  that such a thing doesn't already exist (and if it did, he's more than a little dissappointed he had never been taught it,
  despite the claims that he had received a varied and liberal schooling). Furthermore he believes that the language could be an
  incredably beneficial tool for writers, should they choose to use it; and to elementary school teachers, to enhance their current
  curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership in student writing. The designer has done no practical
  work to validate such a hypothesis, and quite frankly doesn't /[(care | intend)>>or<] to do so anytime soon. But a quick perusal
  of the usage-01.txt file under the bin/ directory at the root should confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center
  of it, has any utility or relevance to the inquisitive individual -- as a word of warning: should one read it, they should
  mind the profanity (where it occurs) and instead focus on the scaffolding's potential usefulness to them (as a literary device to enhance
  their own creativity, to manage their fractured and non-linear thinking patterns, to better explore and refine their ideas, etc), and
  should they find it useful, interesting, or worthy of a book deal, they should consider emailing me, or *sending me money* if they'd like
  for the project to see it's conclusion, much sooner than it would otherwise, with their feedback and their valued input. Just an idea.
