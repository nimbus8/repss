**What is repss?**

  Good question.

  Repss is idea related to context free grammars and the potential infinitum of languages; where such intresting tidbits
  of proof exist that say things like 'many valid languages cannot be recognized' given "machines" wholly deterministic in nature
  (or something like that, quote me at your own risk). This is the kind of stuff that fascinates me, I wouldn't even mind teaching theory 
  of computation to undergrads -- this won't happen, of course (probably a good thing). This project is made catered to two audiences: technical,
  and non-technical. The technical audience s advised to rumage through the source code, and non-technical people (people interested in writing,
  literary education, and linguistics, among other things) are advised to read the below for further clarification.
    
    
  Repss is in part designed to be something like **scaffolding atop written language**. Where usually scaffolding is found on construction sites, in this case
  the scaffolding exists around regions of text that represent uncertainty; those regions, yet to be finalized, are thus "under construction". An interesting
  point to note here is that the "scaffolding" does NOT presuppose the program built here to handle it and recognize it, or even a computer, it
  can be used on paper quite trivially at anytime, this does not take anything away from the concept or the utility. Computers are to handle repetative
  sets of instructions that a human might easily tire of, thus the program that is being developed here in this project is only important when the number of times
  one uses the scaffolding to their advantage gets larger (I have tried to do this to the best of my ability in the bin/usage-01.txt file).  We believe the
  framework language could be an incredably beneficial tool (a boon) for writers, should they choose to use it; and also for elementary school teachers, who might 
  leverage it to enhance their curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership in student writing. As a disclaimer: no practical work has been done
  to validate this, none that would be considered reliable. We have only our personl experience with the language. A quick perusal of the usage-01.txt file, under the
  bin/ directory at the root, should be enough to confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center of it, might be of any utility or at all relevant
  to the inquisitive individual -- one is advised to keep an open mind and to try to focus less on the content (the stories) and more on how they might potentially leverage
  the scaffolding to their benefit (as a literary device: to enhance their creativity; to manage their fractured and non-linear thinking patterns; and better represent, explore,
  and refine their ideas as they come, etc) 
  
  For those interested in linguistics, these examples may be familiar.
  
  1) At 2 in the afternoon **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.
  
  =
  
  At 2 in the afternoon **he** was due at the dentist.

  At 2 in the afternoon **she** was due at the dentist.
  
  ...best of all we can have fun with this! For example:
  
  2) At 2 **/[(** **|** in the afternoon **)]** **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.

  =
  
  At 2 **he** was due at the dentist.

  At 2 **she** was due at the dentist.
  
  At 2 **in the afternoon** *she* was due at the dentist.
  
  At 2 **in the afternoon** *he* was due at the dentist.
  
  ...now imagine if we replaced **was** with **/[(** was **|** were **)]**. Here's a math question (bet you didn't expect that!), how many more variations do we add the last set created in example 2) ?
  What musical and phonetic effects (if any) do we observe in each case as we replace **was** with **were** and read the passage aloud?
  
  More to come!
