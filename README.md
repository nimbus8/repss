**What is repss?**

  Good question.

  Repss is idea related to context free grammars and the potential infinitum of languages; where such intresting tidbits
  of proof exist that say things like 'many valid languages cannot be recognized' given "machines" wholly deterministic in nature
  (or something like that, quote me at your own risk). This project is made catered to two audiences: technical,
  and non-technical. The technical audience s advised to rumage through the source code, and non-technical people (people interested in writing,
  literary education, and linguistics, among other things) are advised to read the below for further clarification.
    
    
  Repss is in part designed to be something like **scaffolding atop written language**. Where usually scaffolding is found on construction sites, in this case
  the scaffolding exists around regions of text that represent uncertainty; those regions, yet to be finalized, are thus "under construction". An interesting
  point to note here is that the "scaffolding" does NOT presuppose the program built here in this project to handle it and recognize it, or even a computer for that matter, it
  can be used on paper quite trivially at anytime, this does not take anything away from the concept or the utility. Computers are to handle repetative
  sets of instructions that a human might easily tire of, thus the program that is being developed here in this project is only important when the number of times
  one uses the scaffolding to their advantage gets larger (I have tried to do this to the best of my ability in the bin/usage-01.txt file).  We believe the
  framework language could be an incredably beneficial tool (a boon) for writers, should they choose to use it; and also for elementary school teachers, who might 
  leverage it to enhance their curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership in student writing. As a disclaimer: no practical work has been done
  to validate these suggestions, none that would be considered reliable. We have only our own personal experience with the language. And again we suggest that a quick 
  perusal of the usage-01.txt file, under the bin/ directory at the root, should be enough to confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center of it,
  might be of any utility -- or you can experiment on paper, mmaybe you'll find it not so difficult to use the scaffolding to your advantage\benefit (as a literary device: to enhance their creativity; to manage their fractured and
  non-linear thinking patterns; and better represent, explore, and refine their ideas as they come, etc) 
  
  (I know what your thinking, this is silly. Believe me this is not so silly. There are much sillier things published every day.)
  
  For those interested in linguistics, these examples may be familiar.
  
  **1)** At 2 in the afternoon **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.
  
  =
  
  At 2 in the afternoon **he** was due at the dentist.

  At 2 in the afternoon **she** was due at the dentist.
  
  ...best of all we can have fun with this! For example:
  
  **2)** At 2 **/[(** **|** in the afternoon **)]** **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.

  =
  
  At 2 **he** was due at the dentist.

  At 2 **she** was due at the dentist.
  
  At 2 **in the afternoon** *she* was due at the dentist.
  
  At 2 **in the afternoon** *he* was due at the dentist.
  
  ...now imagine if we replaced **was** with **/[(** was **|** were **)]**. Here's a math question (bet you didn't expect that!), how many more variations do we add to the last set created in example 2) ?
  What musical and phonetic effects (if any) do we observe in each case as we replace **was** with **were** and read the passage aloud?
  
  [Edit]
  So I've caught flak for my urging children to substitute **were** for **was** inappropriately. Fine, this is fair.
  If it were up to me I'd use **were** everywhere in place of **was**(not here of course). The following is more
  appropriate (still, the focus is on **were**, b/c I have thing for **were**):
  
  
  Were he to have scheduled the appointment properly, at 2 he would be due at the dentist. In which case, judging by time, I'd imagine he were on his way there right now. If not, had he failed miserably as he is known to do from time to time(the clown he is), I wouldn't have the faintest /[(idea | clue)] where he may be.
 
 
  If he had scheduled the appointment properly, at 2 ... .... .... ... 
 
 
  /[(Were he to have | If he had)] scheduled ... ... ... ...
  
  More to come!
