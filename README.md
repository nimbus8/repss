This project is written in "C++11", for no particular reason.

**What is repss?**

  Good question.

  Repss is idea related to context free grammars and the potential infinitum of languages; where such intresting tidbits
  of proof exist that say things like 'many valid languages cannot be recognized' given "machines" wholly deterministic in nature
  (or something like that, quote me at your own risk). This is the kind of stuff that fascinates me, I wouldn't even mind teaching theory 
  of computation to undergrads -- this won't happen, of course (probably a good thing). This project is made catered to two audiences: technical,
  and non-technical. The technical audience s advised to rumage through the source code, and non-technical people (people interested in writing,
  literary education, and linguistics, among other things) are advised to read the below for further clarification.
    
    
  Repss is in part designed to be **a scaffolding atop written language**. The designer of the language first stresses
  that the whole concept is inherently evil and mad-making, and one should seriously think (twice) about the potential ramification
  or damage to their proper functioning before they invest any amount time into learning something so...ultimately, very stupid.
  But still he believes that the language could be an incredably beneficial tool (a boon) for writers, should they choose to use it;
  and to elementary school teachers, who might leverage it to enhance their curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership
  in student writing. It should be noted also that the designer has done no practical work to validate such a hypothesis, and quite
  honestly doesn't /[(care | intend)>>or<] to, ever. But a quick perusal of the usage-01.txt file, under the bin/ directory at
  the root, should be enough to confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center of it, might be of any utility or
  at all relevant to the inquisitive individual -- though be warned: should one read it, they should mind the profanity (where it occurs)
  and instead focus on how they might potentially leverage the scaffolding to their benefit (as a literary device: to enhance their own creativity;
  to manage their fractured and non-linear thinking patterns; and better represent, explore, and refine their ideas as they come, etc) 
  
  
  More to come!
