This project is written in "C++11", for no particular reason.

What is repss?
  Repss is in part designed to be a scaffolding on top of written language. The designer of the language stresses
  that the whole concept is inherently evil and madness-making, and one should think about the potential ramification
  or damage to proper functioning should he invest anytime to learn something so...ultimately, very stupid. But still
  he believes that the language could be an incredably beneficial tool (a boon) for writers, should they choose to use it; and 
  to elementary school teachers, to perhaps enhance their curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership
  in student writing. It should be noted that the designer has done no practical work to validate such a hypothesis, and quite
  honestly doesn't /[(care | intend)>>or<] to do so anytime soon. But a quick perusal of the usage-01.txt file under the bin/ directory at
  the root should confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center of it, might be of any utility or relevant
  to the inquisitive individual -- though be warned: should one read it, they should mind the profanity (where it occurs)
  and instead focus on the scaffolding's potential usefulness to them (as a literary device to enhance their own creativity;
  to manage their fractured and non-linear thinking patterns; to better represent, explore, and refine their ideas, etc), and
  should they find it useful, interesting, or worthy of a book deal, they should consider emailing me, or *sending me money* if they'd 
  like for the project to be completed much sooner than it would otherwise, with the help of their feedback and their valued input. Just an idea.
