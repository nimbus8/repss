This project is written in "C++11", for no particular reason.

What is repss?
  Repss is in part designed to be a scaffolding on top of written language. The designer of the language stresses
  that the whole concept is inherently evil and mad-making, and one should seriously think about the potential ramification
  or damage to their proper functioning before they invest any of their time into learning something so...ultimately, very stupid.
  But still he believes that the language could be an incredably beneficial tool (a boon) for writers *[1]*, should they choose to use it;
  and to elementary school teachers, to perhaps enhance their curriculums and promote greater creativity, pride, and ownership
  in student writing. It should be noted that the designer has done no practical work to validate such a hypothesis, and quite
  honestly doesn't /[(care | intend)>>or<] to, ever. But a quick perusal of the usage-01.txt file, under the bin/ directory at
  the root, should be enough to confirm whether or not this project, or the language at the center of it, might be of any utility or
  relevant to the inquisitive individual -- though be warned: should one read it, they should mind the profanity (where it occurs)
  and instead focus on the scaffolding's potential usefulness to them (as a literary device, to enhance their own creativity;
  to manage their fractured and non-linear thinking patterns; to better represent, explore, and refine their ideas, etc), and
  should they find it useful, interesting, or worthy of a book deal, they should consider emailing me, or *sending me money* if they'd 
  like for the project to be completed much sooner than it would otherwise, with help from their feedback and their valued input. Just an idea.




Footnotes:

[1] *maybe just the mediocre writers like myself...b/c I hear most good writers, the ones worth reading, can write an entire
   novel over the course of a weekend; just one continuous draft written in ink, preferably by feather, without even a bit
   of inspiration - because they have incredably long fingers or a sort of visible abnormality(disfigurement) that makes 
   them different from most people. They're monsters. I don't know about you, but I'm* f***ing *jealous!*
