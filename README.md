# [Repss v0.9.0](http://repsscompiler.com)
 
  Repss is idea related to context free grammars and the potential infinitum of languages; where such intresting tidbits
  of proof exist that say things like 'many valid languages cannot be recognized' given "machines" wholly deterministic in nature
  (or something like that, quote me at your own risk). This project is made catered to two audiences: technical,
  and non-technical. The technical audience s advised to rumage through the source code, and non-technical people (people interested in writing,
  literary education, and linguistics, among other things) are advised to read the below for further clarification.
    
    
  Repss is  designed to be something like a **scaffolding the written language**. We usually think of scaffolding in terms of construction,
  and we think that by using Repss writers more easily revise their work can explore more ideas concurrently. The great thing about this is that
  the "scaffolding" part does not presuppose the program built here in this project to handle it - or even a computer for that matter! 
  It can be used on paper quite easily at anytime, and this does not take anything away from the concept or it's ultimate utility.
  Computers are made to handle repetative sets of instructions that a human might easily tire of, thus the program that is being developed
  here in this project is only really important when the number of times one uses the scaffolding to their advantage gets reasonable large 
  (I have tried to do this to the best of my ability in the bin/usage-01.txt file). 
  
  
  For those interested, here are some short examples:
  
    **1)** At 2 in the afternoon **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.
  
    =
  
    At 2 in the afternoon **he** was due at the dentist.

    At 2 in the afternoon **she** was due at the dentist.
  
    ...best of all we can have fun with this! For example:
  
    **2)** At 2 **/[(** **|** in the afternoon **)]** **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.

    =
  
    At 2 **he** was due at the dentist.

    At 2 **she** was due at the dentist.
  
    At 2 **in the afternoon** *she* was due at the dentist.
  
    At 2 **in the afternoon** *he* was due at the dentist.
