# [Repss v0.9.0](http://repsscompiler.com)
 
  This project is made catered to two audiences: technical, and non-technical. The technical audience is advised to 
  rumage through the source code, I should put up in depth instructions soon. Both technical and non-technical people 
  (people interested in writing, and education, among other things) would likely benefit from reading below.
    
    
  Repss is  designed to be something like a **scaffolding the written language**. We usually think of scaffolding in terms of construction,
  and we think that by using Repss writers more easily revise their work can explore more ideas concurrently. The great thing about this is that
  the "scaffolding" part does not presuppose the program built here in this project to handle it - or even a computer for that matter! 
  It can be used on paper quite easily at anytime, and this does not take anything away from the concept or it's ultimate utility.
  Computers are made to handle repetative sets of instructions that a human might easily tire of, thus the program that is being developed
  here in this project is only really important when the number of times one uses the scaffolding to their advantage gets reasonable large 
  (I have tried to do this to the best of my ability in the bin/usage-01.txt file). 
  
  
  For those interested, here are some short examples:
  
    **1)** At 2 in the afternoon **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.
  
    =
  
    At 2 in the afternoon **he** was due at the dentist.

    At 2 in the afternoon **she** was due at the dentist.
  
    ...best of all we can have fun with this! For example:
  
    **2)** At 2 **/[(** **|** in the afternoon **)]** **/[(** he **|** she **)]** was due at the dentist.

    =
  
    At 2 **he** was due at the dentist.

    At 2 **she** was due at the dentist.
  
    At 2 **in the afternoon** *she* was due at the dentist.
  
    At 2 **in the afternoon** *he* was due at the dentist.
